Rand Paul is fine despite Paul&#39;s staunch opposition to an extension of the Patriot Act.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"Oh it&#39;s good,\" McConnell said when asked about his relationship with Paul on the <i>Joe Elliot Show<\/i> Monday.<\/p>\n\n<p>Paul opposed any extension of the Patriot Act and made particular emphasis on the National Security Agency&#39;s bulk collection of data &mdash; opposition that included an awkward moment on the Senate floor, in which McConnell tried repeatedly to offer short-term extensions of the law to which Paul objected each time. The Senate agreed to a modified reauthorization of the Patriot Act that has small changes to intelligence agencies&#39; control over the bulk collection of data. McConnell supported an extension of the Patriot Act with no changes. <\/p>\n\n<p>\"Look, we just have a difference of opinion on this issue,\" McConnell said. \"This was something that him and I have diametrically opposed views on. Most things we agree on. So I think it&#39;s a mistake to personalize differences of opinions on issues. We have no problems personally.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>The majority leader added earlier in the interview \"no real harm was done\" by the Patriot Act briefly expiring.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"Look, any senator can keep us from going forward,\" the majority leader said when asked about Paul. \"We do most of what we do on unanimous consent. No harm was done. The law expired for a day and a half and the new law replaced it. So no real harm was done.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>Paul was an strong supporter of McConnell&#39;s re-election campaign last year and helped him beat back a challenge from conservative Matt Bevin during the primary campaign. McConnell has since said he&#39;s supporting Paul&#39;s presidential campaign. <\/p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s the audio:<\/p>\n\n\n <p><small><\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\t\n\n\t \n\t\t  <iframe src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F209617013&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_artwork=true\" height=\"166\" width=\"100%\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" ><\/iframe>\n\t  \n\t\n\n\n <p><small><a rel=\"nofollow\"  target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F209617013&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_artwork=true\">w.soundcloud.com<\/a><\/small><\/p>",

Rand Paul is fine despite Paul's staunch opposition to an extension of the Patriot Act.\n\n\"Oh it's good,\" McConnell said when asked about his relationship with Paul on the <i>Joe Elliot Show<\/i> Monday.\n\nPaul opposed any extension of the Patriot Act and made particular emphasis on the National Security Agency's bulk collection of data — opposition that included an awkward moment on the Senate floor, in which McConnell tried repeatedly to offer short-term extensions of the law to which Paul objected each time. The Senate agreed to a modified reauthorization of the Patriot Act that has small changes to intelligence agencies' control over the bulk collection of data. McConnell supported an extension of the Patriot Act with no changes. \n\n\"Look, we just have a difference of opinion on this issue,\" McConnell said. \"This was something that him and I have diametrically opposed views on. Most things we agree on. So I think it's a mistake to personalize differences of opinions on issues. We have no problems personally.\"\n\nThe majority leader added earlier in the interview \"no real harm was done\" by the Patriot Act briefly expiring.\n\n\"Look, any senator can keep us from going forward,\" the majority leader said when asked about Paul. \"We do most of what we do on unanimous consent. No harm was done. The law expired for a day and a half and the new law replaced it. So no real harm was done.\"\n\nPaul was an strong supporter of McConnell's re-election campaign last year and helped him beat back a challenge from conservative Matt Bevin during the primary campaign. McConnell has since said he's supporting Paul's presidential campaign. \n\nHere's the audio:",

The subpoena also has specific implications for anonymous speech.\n\nKyu Youm, a professor at the University of Oregon School of Journalism and First Amendment scholar, called the Justice Department subpoena \"a misplacement of priorities\" in an interview with BuzzFeed News.\n\n\"Generally speaking, anonymity is still a part of freedom of expression, and just because the government wants to unmask the commenters does not mean it has a strong case,\" Youm said. \"At least, if there is doubt as to the validity of the subpoena, anonymity should be given the benefit of the doubt.\"\n\n\"The subpoena is not compelling,\" Youm continued.\n\nThe Justice Department and <i>Reason<\/i> both declined requests for comment.",

Bush will visit three countries most agitated by Russian power — and use the trip to speak out sharply against Putin.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-06/9/0/enhanced/webdr14/enhanced-buzz-24401-1433825677-12.jpg\" width=\"625\" height=\"417\" alt=\"\" /><\/p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Joe Raedle / Getty Images<\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n <p>BERLIN &mdash; If all goes according to plan, Jeb Bush will end this week with a superlative worthy of a campaign bumper sticker: Vladimir Putin&#39;s least favorite Republican. <\/p>\n\n<p>Beginning with a saber-rattling speech here Tuesday, the presidential contender is set to kick off a carefully choreographed five-day tour of European capitals &mdash; from Berlin, to Warsaw, to Tallinn, Estonia &mdash; designed to place him in meetings and photo ops with some of the continent&#39;s leading critics of Putin&#39;s Russia. Aides say the itinerary will help Bush lay out his vision for a more aggressive American stance against Russia, and illustrate what he considers to be the failures of President Obama&#39;s weak-kneed response to Putin&#39;s recent aggression in Eastern Europe. <\/p>\n\n<p>It will also allow Bush to score political points with Republican primary voters back home. The day after he returns from Europe, Bush is expected to officially announce his bid for the presidential nomination in a party where few geopolitical figures are more reviled than Russia&#39;s president. <\/p>\n\n<p>\"Putin looms large in the American imagination in a way that no other Bond villain out there does,\" said Hugh Hewitt, an influential conservative talk radio host. He said the Republican voters he talks to \"cannot name the president of China&hellip; but everybody knows the bare-chested, horseback-riding, Olympics-giving, country-invading Putin.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s true that Putin has achieved a pop culture&ndash;fueled notoriety rarely bestowed upon world leaders. He shows up in best-selling spy novels, and inspires mocking memes that litter the internet. His barely fictionalized clone in the most recent season of <i>House of Cards<\/i> was notable, perhaps, for being the only character in the show who seemed less cartoonish than his real-life counterpart. <\/p>\n\n<p>But Russia&#39;s growing potency as a political issue in 2016 is also emblematic of long-held frustrations on the right with Obama&#39;s foreign policy. When Russia annexed Crimea last year, many American conservatives called for immediate action from the United States, beginning by providing arms to Ukraine. The Obama administration has resisted those calls so far, in favor of economic sanctions and diplomatic pressure.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hewitt has made it his mission to get Republican candidates on the record with regard to their Russia agenda, frequently quizzing them on air about the intricacies of NATO treaties and U.S. Naval policy. It was on Hewitt&#39;s show in March that Bush said the United States should be willing to use military force to prevent Russia from further infringing on the sovereignty of its allies in Eastern Europe &mdash; some of his more elaborative remarks on the topic. Bush also called for more NATO troops to be deployed in the region, and said the United States should start providing Ukraine with weapons. <\/p>\n\n<p>But Bush has not yet distinguished himself as a true Russia hawk when compared to a field of GOP rivals like Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, who regularly turn up on cable news and talk radio to rail against Russian aggression. At times, Bush&#39;s rhetoric has seemed a little vague and unsteady. In a question-and-answer session following a speech earlier this year on his foreign policy agenda, Bush emphasized engaging countries like Germany and stronger support for Ukraine. He also praised Obama for his so-called \"forward lean\" in the Baltics &mdash; but seemed unsure of whether the approach had been successful. \"I don&#39;t know what the effect has been because it&#39;s really kind of hard to be on the road, and I&#39;m just a gladiator these days, so I don&#39;t follow every little detail,\" he said. <\/p>\n\n<p>Here in Berlin, Bush will use his appearance at a major economic conference to sharpen his rhetoric, calling for unified, aggressive NATO action against Putin&#39;s recent provocations.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"Russia must respect the sovereignty of all of its neighbors,\" he is expected to say. \"And who can doubt that Russia will do what it pleases if its aggression goes unanswered? Our alliance, our solidarity, and our actions are essential if we want to preserve the fundamental principles of our international order.\" <\/p>\n\n<p>From Berlin, Bush will head to Poland, an ex-communist state where anti-Russia sentiment permeates the political establishment. Last month, for example, Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski used a high-profile speech to warn that a recent parade in Moscow&#39;s city center commemorating the defeat of Nazi Germany was, in fact, a \"demonstration of force.\" He predicted, ominously, \"Once again, Red Square will turn into Tank Square, and the very same tank divisions which recently invaded Ukraine will be there. This is not about history; it&#39;s about the future.\" <\/p>\n\n<p>While in Warsaw, Bush will meet with Andrzej Duda, the president-elect who recently defeated Komorowski in part by attacking his foreign policy for being too weak. According to Michal Kolanko, co-founder of the insider news website 300Polityka &mdash; a Polish <i>Politico<\/i> clone &mdash; the country&#39;s business and government leaders will welcome the sort of Putin-bashing that plays so well back home. But they may also seek to extract some campaign promises of their own from Bush. <\/p>\n\n<p>\"The U.S. is seen as the only country which could help Poland if the situation goes from bad to worse,\" said Kolanko. \"If there&#39;s some sort of commitment from Bush in regards to U.S. military deployment in Poland, setting permanent bases in Poland, or strengthening U.S. presence in the region, that&#39;d be seen as proof that he &#39;gets it&#39; &mdash; that Putin&#39;s Russia is a Cold War&ndash;type enemy&hellip; There is hope that a GOP administration is going to be more &#39;realistic&#39; and less dithering on Putin than Obama.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>To drive his message home, Bush will conclude his trip across Europe at Russia&#39;s doorstep, touring a NATO cyberdefense facility in Estonia that was formed after the country endured a serious cyberattack that many suspected the Russian government of orchestrating. <\/p>\n\n<p>Estonia&#39;s president, Toomas Hendrik Ilves, has worked urgently to bring attention to what he describes as a dire situation in the region, warning that his country &mdash; and other Baltic states &mdash; are obvious annexation targets for Putin. Asked last year to account for the international community&#39;s lackluster response to Russia&#39;s aggression, Ilves said, \"The West has been in a state of shock.\" <\/p>\n\n<p>When Bush meets with Ilves and his political allies later this week, he will likely present himself as a clear-eyed leader prepared to pry the West from its stupor, and finally confront Putin. Chances are, he&#39;ll be making the same pitch on the campaign trail next week.<\/p>\n\n\n <p><small><\/small><\/p>",

                     "description": "BERLIN — If all goes according to plan, Jeb Bush will end this week with a superlative worthy of a campaign bumper sticker: Vladimir Putin's least favorite Republican. \n \nBeginning with a saber-rattling speech here Tuesday, the presidential contender is set to kick off a carefully choreographed five-day tour of European capitals — from Berlin, to Warsaw, to Tallinn, Estonia — designed to place him in meetings and photo ops with some of the continent's leading critics of Putin's Russia. Aides say the itinerary will help Bush lay out his vision for a more aggressive American stance against Russia, and illustrate what he considers to be the failures of President Obama's weak-kneed response to Putin's recent aggression in Eastern Europe. \n\nIt will also allow Bush to score political points with Republican primary voters back home. The day after he returns from Europe, Bush is expected to officially announce his bid for the presidential nomination in a party where few geopolitical figures are more reviled than Russia's president. \n\n\"Putin looms large in the American imagination in a way that no other Bond villain out there does,\" said Hugh Hewitt, an influential conservative talk radio host. He said the Republican voters he talks to \"cannot name the president of China… but everybody knows the bare-chested, horseback-riding, Olympics-giving, country-invading Putin.\"\n\nIt's true that Putin has achieved a pop culture–fueled notoriety rarely bestowed upon world leaders. He shows up in best-selling spy novels, and inspires mocking memes that litter the internet. His barely fictionalized clone in the most recent season of <i>House of Cards<\/i> was notable, perhaps, for being the only character in the show who seemed less cartoonish than his real-life counterpart. \n\nBut Russia's growing potency as a political issue in 2016 is also emblematic of long-held frustrations on the right with Obama's foreign policy. When Russia annexed Crimea last year, many American conservatives called for immediate action from the United States, beginning by providing arms to Ukraine. The Obama administration has resisted those calls so far, in favor of economic sanctions and diplomatic pressure.\n\nHewitt has made it his mission to get Republican candidates on the record with regard to their Russia agenda, frequently quizzing them on air about the intricacies of NATO treaties and U.S. Naval policy. It was on Hewitt's show in March that Bush said the United States should be willing to use military force to prevent Russia from further infringing on the sovereignty of its allies in Eastern Europe — some of his more elaborative remarks on the topic. Bush also called for more NATO troops to be deployed in the region, and said the United States should start providing Ukraine with weapons. \n\nBut Bush has not yet distinguished himself as a true Russia hawk when compared to a field of GOP rivals like Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, who regularly turn up on cable news and talk radio to rail against Russian aggression. At times, Bush's rhetoric has seemed a little vague and unsteady. In a question-and-answer session following a speech earlier this year on his foreign policy agenda, Bush emphasized engaging countries like Germany and stronger support for Ukraine. He also praised Obama for his so-called \"forward lean\" in the Baltics — but seemed unsure of whether the approach had been successful. \"I don't know what the effect has been because it's really kind of hard to be on the road, and I'm just a gladiator these days, so I don't follow every little detail,\" he said. \n\nHere in Berlin, Bush will use his appearance at a major economic conference to sharpen his rhetoric, calling for unified, aggressive NATO action against Putin's recent provocations.\n\n\"Russia must respect the sovereignty of all of its neighbors,\" he is expected to say. \"And who can doubt that Russia will do what it pleases if its aggression goes unanswered? Our alliance, our solidarity, and our actions are essential if we want to preserve the fundamental principles of our international order.\" \n\nFrom Berlin, Bush will head to Poland, an ex-communist state where anti-Russia sentiment permeates the political establishment. Last month, for example, Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski used a high-profile speech to warn that a recent parade in Moscow's city center commemorating the defeat of Nazi Germany was, in fact, a \"demonstration of force.\" He predicted, ominously, \"Once again, Red Square will turn into Tank Square, and the very same tank divisions which recently invaded Ukraine will be there. This is not about history; it's about the future.\" \n\nWhile in Warsaw, Bush will meet with Andrzej Duda, the president-elect who recently defeated Komorowski in part by attacking his foreign policy for being too weak. According to Michal Kolanko, co-founder of the insider news website 300Polityka — a Polish <i>Politico<\/i> clone — the country's business and government leaders will welcome the sort of Putin-bashing that plays so well back home. But they may also seek to extract some campaign promises of their own from Bush. \n\n\"The U.S. is seen as the only country which could help Poland if the situation goes from bad to worse,\" said Kolanko. \"If there's some sort of commitment from Bush in regards to U.S. military deployment in Poland, setting permanent bases in Poland, or strengthening U.S. presence in the region, that'd be seen as proof that he 'gets it' —&nbsp;that Putin's Russia is a Cold War–type enemy… There is hope that a GOP administration is going to be more 'realistic' and less dithering on Putin than Obama.\"\n\nTo drive his message home, Bush will conclude his trip across Europe at Russia's doorstep, touring a NATO cyberdefense facility in Estonia that was formed after the country endured a serious cyberattack that many suspected the Russian government of orchestrating. \n\nEstonia's president, Toomas Hendrik Ilves, has worked urgently to bring attention to what he describes as a dire situation in the region, warning that his country — and other Baltic states — are obvious annexation targets for Putin. Asked last year to account for the international community's lackluster response to Russia's aggression, Ilves said, \"The West has been in a state of shock.\" \n\nWhen Bush meets with Ilves and his political allies later this week, he will likely present himself as a clear-eyed leader prepared to pry the West from its stupor, and finally confront Putin. Chances are, he'll be making the same pitch on the campaign trail next week.",

What&rsquo;s more, Henry says that being trans has made her a better service member and better doctor.<\/p><p>The 32-year-old Henry joined ROTC almost 15 years ago &mdash; at age 17. She has been &ldquo;treating wounded, ill, and injured&rdquo; service members for 10 years, ever since she did her first rotation in the psych ward at Walter Reed.<\/p><p>Three years ago, however, her life was in upheaval. It was a very difficult time &mdash; she even became homeless briefly &mdash; as she came out as transgender to the people in her life, and dealt with complications to her family, religious, and military life.<\/p><p>One of the key people who helped her through the period was her commanding officer. He provided Henry with housing, helped her continue her military career, and advocated for her family interests &mdash; all while knowing she was transgender. &ldquo;My company commander restored my faith in what it means to be a soldier,&rdquo; she said.<\/p><p>Although Henry began socially transitioning then &mdash; while engaged in a messy divorce and custody dispute &mdash; she did not begin any medical or physical steps until this past fall. At Whitman Walker Health, a Washington-based provider that specializes in LGBT-related health care, she began taking the additional steps. If the social transition was a risk, this posed a bigger one for a military officer. &ldquo;The frank moment came with my command in an emergency department room, because I was afraid, as I was transitioning physically and medically, that I would lose everything.&rdquo;<\/p><p>This wasn&rsquo;t the case, as it turned out &mdash; despite having a new commander who she feared might harbor less positive views of transgender people. &ldquo;My commander said, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care who you love, I don&rsquo;t care how you identify, I want you to be healthy and I want you to be able to do your job,&rsquo;&rdquo; Henry said. &ldquo;I was blown away &hellip; because of the stereotypes that I held, growing up in the South, growing up in a fundamentalist Christian family, that he would automatically think I was a freak, he would automatically think, &lsquo;You need to be discharged just like the regs recommend.&rsquo;&rdquo;<\/p><p>But instead, he posed the question to her, asking what she wanted. &ldquo;I said, &lsquo;If I gave that up over that issue, knowing I can do my job and do it perfectly well, I feel that I&rsquo;d be sacrificing my values and the Army&rsquo;s values.&rsquo;&rdquo;<\/p><p>Her commander agreed, and she stayed. She did, however, have to maintain male grooming standards &mdash; the Army requirements for presentation and appearance. He also gave her a warning at the time. According to Henry, the commanding officer advised her not to speak to media, because if a higher-level commander ordered him to discharge her, he would have to do so.<\/p><p>Even less than a year later, though, the landscape regarding transgender issues has changed significantly.<\/p><p>A few days before Henry spoke with BuzzFeed News, on June 4, the <i>New York Times<\/i> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/04/opinion/transgender-at-war-and-in-love.html\">published<\/a> a documentary by Fiona Dawson, &ldquo;Transgender, at War and in Love,&rdquo; featuring Senior Airman Logan Ireland, an out transgender service member currently serving in Afghanistan, and his fianc&eacute;, Laila Villanueva, also a transgender service member. Later that day, the Air Force, similar to the Army, <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/air-force-takes-a-big-step-toward-allowing-transgender-servi#.vdxqMZb7yR\">raised<\/a> the level of Air Force official responsible for separations based on gender dysphoria and also announced, &ldquo;Neither gender dysphoria nor self-identification as transgender is an automatic circumstance that generates involuntary separation.&rdquo;<\/p><p>In the midst of all this, the Pentagon is set to hold an LGBT pride event hosted by Defense Secretary Ashton Carter on Tuesday. Henry was invited and, despite nearly a month of back and forth with superiors, she said on Sunday that she plans to wear the male dress uniform on Tuesday &ldquo;unless they say otherwise.&rdquo; She noted that she would be doing so &ldquo;mainly because [her] personal timeline for this gender transition is not the same as the DOD&rsquo;s timeline, as we speak. That&rsquo;s the bottom line.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Nonetheless, she will be there, watching for signs of what that timeline is.<\/p><p>&ldquo;On Tuesday, I&rsquo;m looking forward to what the secretary of defense has to say,&rdquo; she said, noting Carter&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/obama-administration-expresses-support-for-out-transgender-m#.qpW1Rbwjmq\">comments<\/a> in February that nothing &ldquo;but their suitability for service should preclude&rdquo; transgender people from serving in the military.<\/p><p>Henry is blunt &mdash; yet pleasant &mdash; about the difficulties she has faced and continues to face.<\/p><p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s awkward. I&rsquo;ve had to embrace awkwardness with gusto these last nine months,&rdquo; she said with a laugh. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not easy. It&rsquo;s not easy for the people that are my family, it&rsquo;s not easy for the people that are my friends prior to my transition.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Explaining the process she has undertaken, she said, &ldquo;Transitioning is very complex. It&rsquo;s not just, like, surgery: one day you&rsquo;re a boy, the next day you&rsquo;re a girl, or vice versa, because you have some operation.&rdquo;<\/p><p>She continued, giving an example: &ldquo;You could talk about returning soldiers, or sailors, or airmen from the war over the last decade that have had mutilation to their genitalia from an IED. Their gender has not changed because they have an injury to their genitalia. OK? They&rsquo;re the same gender they&rsquo;ve always been.<\/p><p>&ldquo;Just like with me: I&rsquo;m the same gender I&rsquo;ve always been in my mind, but all this other stuff, on the outside, is really just conforming to how I already feel and have felt my entire life.&rdquo;<\/p><p>She quickly noted that, along with the difficulties, the process already has changed her life for the better. &ldquo;People say, &lsquo;Is this a choice?&rsquo; The choice is being healthy or sick. I can continue living a sick life, or I can live a healthy life,&rdquo; she said simply, declaring that she has chosen health.<\/p><p>It&rsquo;s also improving her work as a doctor, she said. &ldquo;I find my trans experience has allowed me to relate to people, because all of us suffer, and I could relate to people&rsquo;s suffering. I&rsquo;m able to comfort people that feel isolated and lost and alone and broken. I can sit down with them and look them in the eyes, and say, &lsquo;I can walk with you through this. I care about you, and I mean it.&rsquo;&rdquo;<\/p><p>Talking about her work with SPARTA &mdash; an LGBT service member and veterans group &mdash; Henry said that there are hundreds of people in the group in a similar situation to hers with whom she interacts.<\/p><p>&ldquo;Once you see something, it&rsquo;s hard to look away because my story is not unique,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And as an officer &mdash; as a field-grade officer, a major &mdash; and as a physician, hearing things &mdash; the despair, the feelings of disrespect or humiliation or whatever in not having someone&rsquo;s medical and legal gender recognized &mdash; to hear that day in and day out [has] somewhat emboldened me to lead.&rdquo;<\/p><p>To that end, Henry submitted a statement to the American Medical Association this weekend, asking the association to take a stand in support of trans troops. The <a href=\"http://www.palmcenter.org/files/A-15%20Resoultion%20011.pdf\">resolution<\/a> that was under consideration asked the AMA to affirm that there is no medically valid reason that transgender individuals cannot serve.<\/p><p>&ldquo;Delaying adoption of this policy,&rdquo; she said in her statement, &ldquo;will only serve to further harm those of us who actively serve our country in silence every day. We simply cannot wait.&rdquo;<\/p><p>On Monday afternoon, the organization took her advice and the advice of many others, passing the resolution in question.<\/p><p>Talking with BuzzFeed News, Henry broadened &mdash; and simplified &mdash; the argument she made to the AMA.<\/p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just a trans issue, right? It&rsquo;s a human issue. Can we recognize someone as an individual? Can we recognize the good in them? Can we recognize that they just want to do their job and do it well? Can we give them the circumstances, the environment, the tools to be able to do their job and do it well without the shame and the guilt and the fear and the pain that comes along with being different? Can we do that? Can we do that in a place like America?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I believe we can.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n\n <p><small><\/small><\/p>",

I care about you, and I mean it.&rsquo;&rdquo;<\/p><p>Talking about her work with SPARTA &mdash; an LGBT service member and veterans group &mdash; Henry said that there are hundreds of people in the group in a similar situation to hers with whom she interacts.<\/p><p>&ldquo;Once you see something, it&rsquo;s hard to look away because my story is not unique,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And as an officer &mdash; as a field-grade officer, a major &mdash; and as a physician, hearing things &mdash; the despair, the feelings of disrespect or humiliation or whatever in not having someone&rsquo;s medical and legal gender recognized &mdash; to hear that day in and day out [has] somewhat emboldened me to lead.&rdquo;<\/p><p>To that end, Henry submitted a statement to the American Medical Association this weekend, asking the association to take a stand in support of trans troops. The <a href=\"http://www.palmcenter.org/files/A-15%20Resoultion%20011.pdf\">resolution<\/a> that was under consideration asked the AMA to affirm that there is no medically valid reason that transgender individuals cannot serve.<\/p><p>&ldquo;Delaying adoption of this policy,&rdquo; she said in her statement, &ldquo;will only serve to further harm those of us who actively serve our country in silence every day. We simply cannot wait.&rdquo;<\/p><p>On Monday afternoon, the organization took her advice and the advice of many others, passing the resolution in question.<\/p><p>Talking with BuzzFeed News, Henry broadened &mdash; and simplified &mdash; the argument she made to the AMA.<\/p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just a trans issue, right? It&rsquo;s a human issue. Can we recognize someone as an individual? Can we recognize the good in them? Can we recognize that they just want to do their job and do it well? Can we give them the circumstances, the environment, the tools to be able to do their job and do it well without the shame and the guilt and the fear and the pain that comes along with being different? Can we do that? Can we do that in a place like America?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I believe we can.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n\n <p><small><\/small><\/p>",

It's a big deal.\"\n\nCheney said he was \"fearful\" people have forgotten about 9/11 and a deadlier attack could happen next.\n\n\"I'm fearful that we've gotten far enough away now after 14 years, far enough away from 9/11, that too many people out there have forgotten what happened and what it's like when it does happen. This is the danger that next time they'll have something deadlier than airline tickets and box cutters when they launch an attack.\"\n\nA Paul spokesman responded to Cheney in an email to BuzzFeed News.\n\n\"Sen. Rand Paul agrees with former Vice President Cheney that we must always remain vigilant to the real threat of radical Islamic jihadism, but Sen. Paul, like most Americans, does not believe we should continue the NSA's illegal and expensive bulk collection program which has not led to a single terror conviction or foiled any plots.\"",
