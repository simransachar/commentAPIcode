The report from Kaspersky Labs, a Moscow-based cybersecurity company, stopped short of naming the hotels. BuzzFeed News reached all of the hotels that hosted negotiations, and none appeared to know of a breach in their systems. <\/p>\n\n<p>\"We are not aware of any of these problems. We don&#39;t have any of these types of issues at our hotel and the last [malware] incident we had was six or seven years ago,\" said Patrick De Rosa, a manager at the Intercontinental Hotel in Geneva where talks were held that led to an interim deal.<\/p>\n\n<p>Managers at the Palais Coburg in Austria, and Beau-Rivage Palace in Switzerland told BuzzFeed News that they were also not aware of any breaches, but asked to be given time to look into the Kaspersky report. <\/p>\n\n<p>Kaspersky researchers said they were still assessing how the virus works, and expect to release a full report in the coming weeks. They believe the virus was capable of eavesdropping on conversations, stealing files, and could gain control of any computer-linked system at the hotel, such as phones, elevators and alarms. The virus was also able to access the hotel&#39;s front-desk computes, which gives it access to the room numbers of all the officials taking part in the talks, according to the report. It is unclear whether the virus is still active in the hotels&#39; systems.<\/p>\n\n<p>Kaspersky did not name the country behind the virus, but the <i>Wall Street Journal<\/i>, which first reported the findings, said it was hinting that it was Israel. The report was named \"Duqu Bet\" with Bet being the second letter of the Hebrew alphabet and the virus widely being called \"Duqu 2.0\" by Kaspersky researchers. <\/p>\n\n<p>There had already been accusations of Israel spying on the negotiations. In March, the <i>Wall Street Journal<\/i> <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/spy-virus-linked-to-israel-targeted-hotels-used-for-iran-nuclear-talks-1433937601\">reported<\/a> that Israel had spied on the closed-door meetings, and \"acquired information from confidential U.S. briefings, informants and diplomatic contacts in Europe.\" The report said U.S. intelligence agencies spying on Israel found that the Israelis had obtained details of the talks, though at the time Israeli officials <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.648496\">claimed<\/a> they had been briefed by other countries participating in the negotiations. <\/p>\n\n<p>Kaspersky&#39;s researchers concludes that the virus was an improved version of spyware first discovered by the Symantec cybersecurity firm in 2011, and named as Duqu because it creates files with \"DQ\" in the prefix. Kaspersky has since said the virus appeared to be very similar to Stuxnet, a computer worm that hit computers at Iranian nuclear facilities.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"The people behind Duqu are one of the most skilled and powerful APT (Advanced Persistent Threats) groups and they did everything possible to try to stay under the radar,\" said Costin Raiu, director of Kaspersky Lab&#39;s Global Research &amp; Analysis Team, in a statement emailed to BuzzFeed News. Advanced persistent threats refer to sophisticated software created by nation-states and often used for cyber espionage or complex cyber crime. <\/p>\n\n<p>Raiu said the cost of creating such sophisticated malware must have been \"very high.\" In addition to running a 19-megabyte toolkit, capable of sophisticated data theft, the virus could operate stealthily from inside an infected computer by operating only in the machine&#39;s memory, rather than its hard drive.<\/p>\n\n<p>In addition to the hotels, Kaspersky said they also found the virus on computers used during the commemoration ceremony of the 70th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi death camp Auschwitz, an event that was attended by world leaders.<\/p>\n\n<p>The virus in the systems was discovered only after Kaspersky first identified the virus in their own systems. A Kaspersky researcher testing the company&#39;s new detection software noticed an anomaly and discovered the virus. The virus was gathering information on how Kaspersky detected new malware, likely in an effort to better hide itself. <\/p>\n\n<p>It appeared that the actors behind Duqu 2.0 knew they were being discovered as it happened. Just four hours after Kaspersky identified an employee&#39;s machine in Asia that had been the first to upload the virus (by opening a spear-phishing email), the machine&#39;s mailbox and browsing history were wiped, preventing Kaspersky from fully analyzing it. <\/p>\n\n<p>In the coming weeks, Kaspersky researchers said they would study backups and logs which should have more details on how the virus spreads through systems.<\/p>\n\n\n <p><small><\/small><\/p>",

Still no Jim Luers.<\/p><p>A spokesperson at FBI headquarters also confirmed to BuzzFeed News that no such person works for them.<\/p><p>What the editors <i>did<\/i> discover was that the career of Caracas&rsquo; favorite White House spokesman actually began years ago. Not only had Luers been quoted on a variety of topics by several media outlets since 2010, he had also undergone a series of lighting-quick career changes. In the space of five years, he <a href=\"http://www.diarioelprogreso.com/edi-140610/html/pag12-A.htm\">weighed in<\/a> on money laundering as an FBI agent, <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/venezuela/article23239719.html\">spoke<\/a> on behalf of the Treasury Department, and <a href=\"http://www.talcualdigital.com/Nota/115536/Aventuras-De-Jim-Luers\">became<\/a> a representative of &ldquo;The Inteligence Week&rdquo; (yes, with only one &ldquo;l&rdquo;).<\/p><p>While Luers&rsquo;s exact origin remains unclear, the independent paper <i>Tal Cual<\/i> <a href=\"http://www.talcualdigital.com/Nota/115536/Aventuras-De-Jim-Luers\">suspected<\/a> he was invented by the Caracas weekly <i>Quinto D&iacute;a<\/i>. The source of inspiration for Luers&rsquo; name is less of a mystery: William H. Luers <a href=\"http://uscpublicdiplomacy.org/users/william_h_luers/\">served<\/a> as ambassador to Venezuela from 1978 to 1982.<\/p><p>In an interview with BuzzFeed News, New York-based journalist Mario Szichman, who <a href=\"http://www.talcualdigital.com/Nota/115536/Aventuras-De-Jim-Luers\">conducted<\/a> his own investigation into Jim Luers for <i>Tal Cual,<\/i> highlighted the absurdity that underlies how the fictional agent came into being.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-06/10/9/enhanced/webdr05/longform-29036-1433941878-2.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"197\" alt=\"\" /><\/p>\n \n\t<p>National Assembly President Diosdado (right) next to Venezuela&#39;s President Nicolas Maduro.<\/p>\n\n\n <p><small>Ariana Cubillos / AP<\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;In a democracy there is the separation of powers,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A denial of the accusations against Cabello would have to come from a spokesperson of the Justice Department. Whoever made up the false rumor spread by <i>Quinto D&iacute;a<\/i> believes that the separation of powers is just a pipe dream, like what happens in his country.&rdquo;<\/p><p>One would think that proving he never existed would allow the FBI agent/spokesperson/investigator a hard-earned early retirement. But supporters of the current regime remain eager to keep the mythical jack-of-all-trades alive, judging by his burgeoning web presence.<\/p><p>Last week, a Twitter account claiming to represent Jim Luers, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RealJimLuers\">@RealJimLuers<\/a>, popped up, complete with links to a <a href=\"https://jimluers.wordpress.com/\">blog<\/a> in which the storied Luers discusses his views on inter-American policy and compares Latin American colonial liberator Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var to George Washington. But nothing on his now infamous quote about Cabello.<\/p><p>@RealJimLuers, who claims to serve as &ldquo;a White House spokesperson and FBI Agent with responsibility for the Western Hemisphere&rdquo; (a lot of responsibility), advertises such all-American interests as &ldquo;satire&rdquo; and &ldquo;college basketball,&rdquo; and has dialogue with supporters from as far away as Germany. In less than a week he has already amassed over 2,000 followers.<\/p><p>He also has the same face as Secretary of the Treasury Jack Lew.<\/p><p>Jackson Diehl of the <i>Washington Post<\/i> was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JacksonDiehl/status/606515392496967680\">quick to point out<\/a> the resemblance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n<p>So while the sight of a fake FBI agent with the Treasury secretary&rsquo;s face may be good for a laugh, the climate for journalists in Venezuela continues to decline. &ldquo;The censorship will continue increasing. Opposition papers will continue closing,&rdquo; Szichman, the New York-based reporter said. And so Jim Luers lives on.<\/p>\n\n\n <p><small><\/small><\/p>",

Still no Jim Luers.<\/p><p>A spokesperson at FBI headquarters also confirmed to BuzzFeed News that no such person works for them.<\/p><p>What the editors <i>did<\/i> discover was that the career of Caracas&rsquo; favorite White House spokesman actually began years ago. Not only had Luers been quoted on a variety of topics by several media outlets since 2010, he had also undergone a series of lighting-quick career changes. In the space of five years, he <a href=\"http://www.diarioelprogreso.com/edi-140610/html/pag12-A.htm\">weighed in<\/a> on money laundering as an FBI agent, <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/venezuela/article23239719.html\">spoke<\/a> on behalf of the Treasury Department, and <a href=\"http://www.talcualdigital.com/Nota/115536/Aventuras-De-Jim-Luers\">became<\/a> a representative of &ldquo;The Inteligence Week&rdquo; (yes, with only one &ldquo;l&rdquo;).<\/p><p>While Luers&rsquo;s exact origin remains unclear, the independent paper <i>Tal Cual<\/i> <a href=\"http://www.talcualdigital.com/Nota/115536/Aventuras-De-Jim-Luers\">suspected<\/a> he was invented by the Caracas weekly <i>Quinto D&iacute;a<\/i>. The source of inspiration for Luers&rsquo; name is less of a mystery: William H. Luers <a href=\"http://uscpublicdiplomacy.org/users/william_h_luers/\">served<\/a> as ambassador to Venezuela from 1978 to 1982.<\/p><p>In an interview with BuzzFeed News, New York-based journalist Mario Szichman, who <a href=\"http://www.talcualdigital.com/Nota/115536/Aventuras-De-Jim-Luers\">conducted<\/a> his own investigation into Jim Luers for <i>Tal Cual,<\/i> highlighted the absurdity that underlies how the fictional agent came into being.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-06/10/9/enhanced/webdr05/longform-29036-1433941878-2.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"197\" alt=\"\" /><\/p>\n \n\t<p>National Assembly President Diosdado (right) next to Venezuela&#39;s President Nicolas Maduro.<\/p>\n\n\n <p><small>Ariana Cubillos / AP<\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;In a democracy there is the separation of powers,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A denial of the accusations against Cabello would have to come from a spokesperson of the Justice Department. Whoever made up the false rumor spread by <i>Quinto D&iacute;a<\/i> believes that the separation of powers is just a pipe dream, like what happens in his country.&rdquo;<\/p><p>One would think that proving he never existed would allow the FBI agent/spokesperson/investigator a hard-earned early retirement. But supporters of the current regime remain eager to keep the mythical jack-of-all-trades alive, judging by his burgeoning web presence.<\/p><p>Last week, a Twitter account claiming to represent Jim Luers, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RealJimLuers\">@RealJimLuers<\/a>, popped up, complete with links to a <a href=\"https://jimluers.wordpress.com/\">blog<\/a> in which the storied Luers discusses his views on inter-American policy and compares Latin American colonial liberator Sim&oacute;n Bol&iacute;var to George Washington. But nothing on his now infamous quote about Cabello.<\/p><p>@RealJimLuers, who claims to serve as &ldquo;a White House spokesperson and FBI Agent with responsibility for the Western Hemisphere&rdquo; (a lot of responsibility), advertises such all-American interests as &ldquo;satire&rdquo; and &ldquo;college basketball,&rdquo; and has dialogue with supporters from as far away as Germany. In less than a week he has already amassed over 2,000 followers.<\/p><p>He also has the same face as Secretary of the Treasury Jack Lew.<\/p><p>Jackson Diehl of the <i>Washington Post<\/i> was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JacksonDiehl/status/606515392496967680\">quick to point out<\/a> the resemblance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n<p>So while the sight of a fake FBI agent with the Treasury secretary&rsquo;s face may be good for a laugh, the climate for journalists in Venezuela continues to decline. &ldquo;The censorship will continue increasing. Opposition papers will continue closing,&rdquo; Szichman, the New York-based reporter said. And so Jim Luers lives on.<\/p>\n\n\n <p><small><\/small><\/p>",

The girl was suffering from stomach pains, and her mother feared she had a tumor.\n\nAfter a medical examination, doctors determined that the girl was 21 weeks pregnant, according to the IACHR.\n\nThe <i>Washington Post<\/i> <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/05/11/the-horrific-child-rape-case-that-is-tearing-paraguay-apart/\">reported<\/a> that child's mother believed her husband, Gilberto Benitez (the girl's stepfather), raped her, and gave his name to authorities. \n\nShe also sought an abortion for her daughter.\n\nBenitez fled but was captured by police two weeks later; he denied the rape allegations. \n\nOn May 12, a team of physicians, psychologists, and psychiatrists conducted a thorough medical examination of the girl and concluded that \"she ran the risk of postpartum hemorrhaging, a high risk of endometrial infection and a slew of other systematic risks to her not fully developed reproductive health system\" if she continued with her pregnancy.\n\nShe reportedly weighed 75 pounds at the time of the examinations.\n\nBut Paraguayan law restricts abortions to women whose lives would be put at risk if they give birth. Despite doctors' warnings of health risks, the national Ministry of Health determined that the girl's life was not in danger, and denied her access to receiving medical care.\n\nThe IACHR is a leading human rights organization in North and South America, and issued the Paraguayan government a <a href=\"http://www.oas.org/es/cidh/decisiones/pdf/2015/MC178-15-ES.pdf\">resolution<\/a> on June 8 at the urging of several NGOs. Amnesty International also <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/articles/news/2015/04/paraguay-raped-10-year-old-must-be-allowed-an-abortion/\">advocated<\/a> for the girl in April.\n\nThe resolution argues that \"the young girl's rights to life and personal integrity, as well as mental and physical health, have been put at grave risk by the Paraguay government denying her a safe and legal abortion.\"\n\nAccording to <a href=\"http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/2483907/0/derechos-humanos/nina-paraguaya/embarazada-10-anos/\">local media reports<\/a>, the IACHR gave the government 72 hours, or until June 11, to respond to its demands.",
