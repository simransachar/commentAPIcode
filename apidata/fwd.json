To Meadows, remotely giving out pills after a video session is no different than physically dropping them into the patient&#39;s hand &mdash; it&#39;s just more convenient for the patient. \"It&#39;s the exact same type of encounter either way,\" Meadows told BuzzFeed News.<\/p>\n\n<p>The Iowa Board of Medicine disagrees, and adopted a rule in 2013 that would effectively ban telemedical abortions on the grounds that they improperly supervise and endanger women.

At the time, June was president of Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, as the branch overseeing Iowa, Nebraska, Arkansas, and Eastern Oklahoma is known.

The state has the <a href=\"http://www.iowamedical.org/documents/physicianworkforce/2011PhysicianPopulationOverallStateRankings.pdf\">43rd lowest doctor-to-resident ratio<\/a> in the nation, and the law only permits a licensed physician to provide abortion pills.<\/p>\n\n<p>Medical abortions can be carried out with different medications, each requiring specific dosages, but the most common regimen consists of the tablets mifepristone, which causes the uterus&#39;s lining to break down by blocking a key pregnancy hormone, and misoprostol, which expels the embryo from the body. From 2000 to 2011, <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DrugSafety/PostmarketDrugSafetyInformationforPatientsandProviders/UCM263353.pdf\">more than 1.5 million U.S. women<\/a> underwent medical abortions; they now account for about <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6311a1.htm\">one-fifth<\/a> of all abortions.<\/p>\n\n<p>In the model that now exists at seven out of 13 Planned Parenthood clinics in Iowa, patients first undergo an ultrasound and exam in person with a nurse, nurse practitioner, medical assistant, or trained educator. The clinician sits in the room as the patient talks to a doctor elsewhere through a two-way videoconferencing program that&#39;s similar to Skype, but secure and designed for health care. Then the patient takes the mifepristone, pockets the misoprostol, and arranges to return in two weeks to ensure the pills worked, Planned Parenthood says. She is given a 24-hour help line to call in the meantime.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"It means those women don&#39;t have to travel 250 miles into Des Moines, take four days off work, maybe find child care, maybe find transportation if they don&#39;t have it,\" Angie Remington, a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood of the Heartland, told BuzzFeed News. \"This is a way to make it so they don&#39;t have as many barriers.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>And it gives women access to abortions earlier, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3518368/\">according to a 2013 study in the <i>American Journal of Public Health<\/i><\/a>.

                     "description": "A major concern of the Iowa medical board, and of pro-life groups such as Iowa Right to Life, is that the program is \"inconsistent\" with guidelines the FDA approved when it approved mifepristone in 2000. Under those guidelines, a woman should visit a doctor three times: to receive 600 milligrams of mifepristone; two days later, to take 400 micrograms of misoprostol; and two weeks later for a follow-up. She can be up to seven weeks pregnant.\n \nSince then, clinicians have tried to make the practice more affordable and convenient. For all medical abortions, Planned Parenthood now prescribes a lower dose of mifepristone and a higher dose of misoprostol. Women can also take the second pill at home and seek a medical abortion up to nine weeks into gestation.\n \nTechnically, this regimen is off-label. But a meta-analysis of 58 studies, <a href=\"http://www.cochrane.org/CD002855/FERTILREG_medical-methods-for-early-termination-of-pregnancy-can-be-safe-and-effective\">published in the <i>Cochrane Review<\/i> in 2011<\/a>, reported that medical abortions have \"a very low rate of major complications,\" and that mifepristone and misoprostol are safe and effective up to the ninth week. The regimen used at Planned Parenthood also has a 95% to 99% success rate, <a href=\"http://www.acog.org/-/media/Practice-Bulletins/Committee-on-Practice-Bulletins----Gynecology/Public/pb143.pdf?dmc=1&amp;ts=20150526T1925352570\">studies show<\/a>.\n \nWomen can bleed and cramp more with medical abortions, and some will still require surgery if the pills fail to work, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists acknowledges. But overall, the national group of clinicians says, it is safe and effective for women to take misoprostol at home and have telemedical abortions that involve nonphysician clinicians.\n \n\"The most important thing is it's evidence-based,\" said Meadows, medical director of Planned Parenthood of the Heartland.\n \nAt least one former employee disagrees. Sue Thayer, a Planned Parenthood clinic manager in Storm Lake, Iowa, for 17 years, claims she was let go in 2008 because she <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/jan/31/planned-parenthoods-big-lie/\">objected<\/a> to its telemedicine abortion program. Now a leading antiabortion activist, she is suing the organization for allegedly overbilling Medicaid. A lawyer for Planned Parenthood declined to comment on the lawsuit.",

The breach on the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/sheerafrenkel/chinese-hackers-believed-responsible-for-one-of-the-largest\">first disclosed<\/a> last week, is already the largest breach in U.S. government history. The OPM said it was currently working with the FBI, as well as with other relevant bodies, to determine the extent of the breach, which could affect <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/business/technology/article/Union-says-all-federal-workers-fell-victim-to-6322919.php\">many more employees<\/a> than originally disclosed.<\/p><p>Matthew Palmer, who recently quit his job at the State Department, said he did not receive the email but was notified by a colleague that he should &ldquo;change every password ever created.&rdquo;<\/p><p>&ldquo;I basically vacillate between being really panicked and being really angry at the government that this information was not secured in some better way,&rdquo; said Palmer. &ldquo;Who is in danger? I listed friends on those forms and my family members&hellip; are some hackers going to start going after them?&rdquo;<\/p><p>Palmer said that the email sent to federal employees Friday from the OPM read like a &ldquo;panic button.&rdquo;<\/p><p>&ldquo;They are basically telling us to be suspicious of everything and just keep checking to see if someone steals our identity, but how is that an actual plan if millions of us were affected?&rdquo; asked Palmer. The email, which included specific details on how the OPM would notify employees if their data was hacked, and how to verify the details of the sender was designed so it could not be forwarded &ndash; though it was just as easy to cut-and-paste the text of the message.<\/p><p>The email also includes warnings against phishing attacks, as well as false URL&rsquo;s and strange attachments in emails.<\/p><p>&ldquo;It just seems like a basic &lsquo;101 to stay safe on the internet&rsquo; rather than a specific plan of actions,&rdquo; said Palmer. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a week and we still have no idea what they are doing to protect us.&rdquo;<\/p><p>While Palmer agreed to speak on record as he is no longer employed by the U.S. government, several other current federal employees only agreed to speak to BuzzFeed News if they could remain anonymous.<\/p><p>The government employees described being in a &ldquo;collective panic&rdquo; about the hack of their personal data.<br /><\/p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand how detailed the forms are. It&rsquo;s over a hundred pages of you listing everything about yourself &ndash; who you are sleeping with, who your friends are &ndash; it&rsquo;s like a cheat sheet to your life,&rdquo; said a State Department employee in Washington D.C. &ldquo;I just went and changed my bank password because part of it was my elementary school&rsquo;s name, and that name is in my file.&rdquo;<\/p><p>The 117-page questionnaire that all federal employees must complete upon being hired asks detailed questions about a new employees personal and private life. The questions, intended to insure that the employees do not have a conflict of interest and to allow the government to vet those around them, can be found online.<\/p><p>&ldquo;It just seems like if there was ever anything that you should protect, it would be these files,&rdquo; said the State Department employee.<\/p><p>One U.S. diplomat, who only recently married the man he has been dating for over 10 years, said the breach was a &ldquo;worst case scenario.&rdquo;<\/p><p>&ldquo;I worked in the Arab World a long time, so I always kept my private life private. My husband and I are now trying to figure out if I can continue my career here, or if we are no longer safe,&rdquo; he told BuzzFeed News by phone, from a country in the Middle East, where he is currently stationed.<\/p><p>But not every State Department employee remains convinced of the severity of the breach. \"We&#39;re sort of meh about it all,\" another current employee told BuzzFeed News after speaking with coworkers. \"After five tours in high-to-critical threat intelligence risk posts, I figure pretty much every hostile government has my personal info, medical records, and sexual proclivities well figured out.\"<\/p><p>On Thursday, the President of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) claimed that all federal employees and retirees, as well as one million former federal employees, had their <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/tamerragriffin/federal-workers-social-security-numbers-leaked-by-cyber-back\">personal information stolen<\/a> in the OPM breach. The AP later <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/business/technology/article/Union-says-all-federal-workers-fell-victim-to-6322919.php\">ran a story<\/a> quoting unnamed sources estimating that 14 million current and former U.S. government employees had their data exposed.<\/p><p>&ldquo;Based on the sketchy information OPM has provided, we believe that the Central Personnel Data File was the targeted database, and that the hackers are now in possession of all personnel data for every federal employee, every federal retiree, and up to one million former federal employees,&rdquo; wrote AFGE President J. David Cox. \"We believe that hackers have every affected person&rsquo;s Social Security number(s), military records and veterans&rsquo; status information, address, birth date, job and pay history, health insurance, life insurance, and pension information; age, gender, race union status, and more.&rdquo;<br /><\/p><p>Cox is not satisfied with the Federal government&#39;s current plan to offer those affected by the hack with 18 months of credit monitoring and up to $1 million liability, he told BuzzFeed News on Friday in a phone interview from Charlotte, NC.

The breach on the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/sheerafrenkel/chinese-hackers-believed-responsible-for-one-of-the-largest\">first disclosed<\/a> last week, is already the largest breach in U.S. government history. The OPM said it was currently working with the FBI, as well as with other relevant bodies, to determine the extent of the breach, which could affect <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/business/technology/article/Union-says-all-federal-workers-fell-victim-to-6322919.php\">many more employees<\/a> than originally disclosed.<\/p><p>Matthew Palmer, who recently quit his job at the State Department, said he did not receive the email but was notified by a colleague that he should &ldquo;change every password ever created.&rdquo;<\/p><p>&ldquo;I basically vacillate between being really panicked and being really angry at the government that this information was not secured in some better way,&rdquo; said Palmer. &ldquo;Who is in danger? I listed friends on those forms and my family members&hellip; are some hackers going to start going after them?&rdquo;<\/p><p>Palmer said that the email sent to federal employees Friday from the OPM read like a &ldquo;panic button.&rdquo;<\/p><p>&ldquo;They are basically telling us to be suspicious of everything and just keep checking to see if someone steals our identity, but how is that an actual plan if millions of us were affected?&rdquo; asked Palmer. The email, which included specific details on how the OPM would notify employees if their data was hacked, and how to verify the details of the sender was designed so it could not be forwarded &ndash; though it was just as easy to cut-and-paste the text of the message.<\/p><p>The email also includes warnings against phishing attacks, as well as false URL&rsquo;s and strange attachments in emails.<\/p><p>&ldquo;It just seems like a basic &lsquo;101 to stay safe on the internet&rsquo; rather than a specific plan of actions,&rdquo; said Palmer. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a week and we still have no idea what they are doing to protect us.&rdquo;<\/p><p>While Palmer agreed to speak on record as he is no longer employed by the U.S. government, several other current federal employees only agreed to speak to BuzzFeed News if they could remain anonymous.<\/p><p>The government employees described being in a &ldquo;collective panic&rdquo; about the hack of their personal data.<br /><\/p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand how detailed the forms are. It&rsquo;s over a hundred pages of you listing everything about yourself &ndash; who you are sleeping with, who your friends are &ndash; it&rsquo;s like a cheat sheet to your life,&rdquo; said a State Department employee in Washington D.C. &ldquo;I just went and changed my bank password because part of it was my elementary school&rsquo;s name, and that name is in my file.&rdquo;<\/p><p>The 117-page questionnaire that all federal employees must complete upon being hired asks detailed questions about a new employees personal and private life. The questions, intended to insure that the employees do not have a conflict of interest and to allow the government to vet those around them, can be found online.<\/p><p>&ldquo;It just seems like if there was ever anything that you should protect, it would be these files,&rdquo; said the State Department employee.<\/p><p>One U.S. diplomat, who only recently married the man he has been dating for over 10 years, said the breach was a &ldquo;worst case scenario.&rdquo;<\/p><p>&ldquo;I worked in the Arab World a long time, so I always kept my private life private. My husband and I are now trying to figure out if I can continue my career here, or if we are no longer safe,&rdquo; he told BuzzFeed News by phone, from a country in the Middle East, where he is currently stationed.<\/p><p>But not every State Department employee remains convinced of the severity of the breach. \"We&#39;re sort of meh about it all,\" another current employee told BuzzFeed News after speaking with coworkers. \"After five tours in high-to-critical threat intelligence risk posts, I figure pretty much every hostile government has my personal info, medical records, and sexual proclivities well figured out.\"<\/p><p>On Thursday, the President of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) claimed that all federal employees and retirees, as well as one million former federal employees, had their <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/tamerragriffin/federal-workers-social-security-numbers-leaked-by-cyber-back\">personal information stolen<\/a> in the OPM breach.

Now a second layer of computers are picking through the choices made by the first.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-06/11/18/enhanced/webdr09/enhanced-buzz-10543-1434060740-7.jpg\" width=\"625\" height=\"440\" alt=\"\" /><\/p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>MARK RALSTON / Getty Images<\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n <p>Most of the day, a small asset management firm in Seattle doesn&#39;t buy anything. A single computer just sits there, waiting. <\/p>\n\n<p>And then, seven times a day, about 200 computers owned by Amazon light up and start replicating that single, sleepy server and begin running software to analyze loans made to individuals, largely to refinance their credit card debt. They&#39;re not looking for just any kind of borrower though &mdash; they want loans made to borrowers with prime credit, but not the best credit of the bunch, who usually want to refinance their credit card debt. <\/p>\n\n<p>A package of those kind of loans that will earn an investor 10% a year. And then, once the analysis is done &mdash; about 850 milliseconds later &mdash; it&#39;s all over, and things revert to that single computer in Seattle.<\/p>\n\n<p>This is the bread-and-butter business of LendingRobot, which manages its clients&#39; money and invests it in loans issued by online lenders. The company started two years ago when two men whose companies had been bought by Microsoft, Emmanuel Marot and Gilad Golan, started buying up loans from Lending Club, the biggest online marketplace lender for consumers. <\/p>\n\n<p>Soon, the pair realized the kind of loans they wanted to buy were being snapped up before they could get to them. Without automating the process, they couldn&#39;t diversify their holdings across many loans. <\/p>\n\n<p>While Lending Club makes its loans available to investors to buy into over a two-week period, \"in reality, the most popular loans are gone in five seconds,\" Marot said.<\/p>\n\n\n <p><small><\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-06/11/18/enhanced/webdr06/enhanced-buzz-25787-1434060697-8.jpg\" width=\"625\" height=\"435\" alt=\"\" /><\/p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>STEPHANIE PILICK / Getty Images<\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n <p>The other thing LendingRobot does is work on top of Lending Club&#39;s own secondary market for loans. Lending Club loans are paid back over terms as long as five years, and investors sometimes want to cash out before then, selling off their holdings to others. So LendingRobot dynamically prices its clients&#39; loans until they&#39;re able to find a price to sell them at. <\/p>\n\n<p>\"If you want to put $50,000 in 2,000 loans, that&#39;s $25 dollars in each loan,\" Marot said. \"The problem we&#39;re addressing is when you want to exit and cash out.\" Starting yesterday, LendingRobot can now automate the buying and selling of Lending Club loans. <\/p>\n\n<p>Marot estimates that a portfolio of loans managed by LendingRobot will return 10% a year, while a random assortment of Lending Club loans would return 7%. <\/p>\n\n<p>And he&#39;s an enthusiastic salesman for the product: during our interview, he twice asked I was invested in or wanted to invest in marketplace loans.

                     "description": "Most of the day, a small asset management firm in Seattle doesn't buy anything. A single computer just sits there, waiting. \n\nAnd then, seven times a day, about 200 computers owned by Amazon light up and start replicating that single, sleepy server and begin running software to analyze loans made to individuals, largely to refinance their credit card debt. They're not looking for just any kind of borrower though — they want loans made to borrowers with prime credit, but not the best credit of the bunch, who usually want to refinance their credit card debt. \n\nA package of those kind of loans that will earn an investor 10% a year. And then, once the analysis is done — about 850 milliseconds later — it's all over, and things revert to that single computer in Seattle.\n\nThis is the bread-and-butter business of LendingRobot, which manages its clients' money and invests it in loans issued by online lenders. The company started two years ago when two men whose companies had been bought by Microsoft, Emmanuel Marot and Gilad Golan, started buying up loans from Lending Club, the biggest online marketplace lender for consumers. \n\nSoon, the pair realized the kind of loans they wanted to buy were being snapped up before they could get to them. Without automating the process, they couldn't diversify their holdings across many loans. \n\nWhile Lending Club makes its loans available to investors to buy into over a two-week period, \"in reality, the most popular loans are gone in five seconds,\" Marot said.",

A workable strategy for an upstart company operating in a handful of markets, it&#39;s not one that scales well -- particularly for companies undergoing the sort of dramatic growth Lyft has experienced.

For the blind, the issue is obvious: Unlike normal text, pictures can't be interpreted by the screen readers many — if not most — visually impaired people (including me) use to navigate the web. If screenshorts continue to gain popularity the way so many breathless blog posts predict they will, the internet will become significantly less accessible to <a href=\"http://www.iapb.org/vision-2020/global-facts\">hundreds of millions<\/a> of people all over the world.\n\nBut not only are screenshorts near-useless for the blind and visually impaired, these static, un-highlightable, un-copyable, un-searchable blocks of text threaten to \"blind\" the internet writ large. Put simply: When you take a screenshot of text, the information therein is lost. This makes screenshorts effectively invisible to blind people's screen readers — but it also prevents the text from being found easily by <i>anyone<\/i> who wants to locate or index it later. The real important data — the text data — is stripped, and if the text isn't published somewhere else, it can never be found in a search engine, either.",

                     "description": "Last summer was when screenshorts — or at least a version of them — first gained some legitimacy on Twitter, as the platform itself began experimenting with an official feature to enhance tweets with images of other tweets (this has now become \"<a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/ellencushing/you-can-now-retweet-with-comment-on-twitter#.synJME28x\">retweet with comment<\/a>\"). At the time, <i>Mashable<\/i> attributed the move to Twitter's push toward becoming \"<a href=\"http://mashable.com/2014/06/23/twitter-experiments/?utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Mashable+%28Mashable%29&amp;utm_cid=Mash-Prod-RSS-Feedburner-All-Partial&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_source=feedburner\">a more visual service<\/a>,\" much in the way of Facebook and other social networks.\n\nThough that feature wasn't exactly a screenshort, its rollout was enough to worry many members of the blind community, including assistive technology consultant Jonathan Mosen, who wrote a blog post suggesting that the new trend toward a more visual Twitter could <a href=\"http://mosen.org/index.php/could-blind-people-be-facing-the-end-of-a-twitter-golden-era-of-accessibility/\">signify the end<\/a> of a \"golden era\" for Twitter's accessibility. At the time, Twitter was an ideal social network for the blind: linear, text-heavy, streamlined, and digestible, easily consumed via <a href=\"https://www.afb.org/ProdBrowseCatResults.asp?CatID=49\">screen reader<\/a>. For that reason, Mosen wrote, \"Twitter ... represents one of the most empowering aspects of the Net for disabled people.\" Mosen said he hoped Twitter would keep this in mind as it developed the feature. \"I think it's better to raise these issues now, and seek clarification, than to play ostrich and then complain about the degraded accessibility when it's too late.\"\n\nTwitter was listening. Two days after Mosen's post, Twitter addressed the issue head-on, breaking its policy of not commenting on experimental features to reach out to Mosen directly. A Twitter spokesperson told him that if any official updates were made to the service, they would be entirely accessible to the blind. \"It's reassuring that Twitter is so cognisant of accessibility issues,\" Mosen <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fmosen.org%2Findex.php%2Fthe-official-word-from-twitter-regarding-the-experimental-retweet-with-comment-feature%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHUqOuBNVV0kgar5vZbhv9Z6oaZHA\">wrote<\/a>. \n\nBut if the blind community dodged a bullet in Twitter's official rollout of graphic retweets, something much bigger was coming in the form of the widespread adoption of screenshorts. In December, M.G. Siegler published <a href=\"https://500ish.com/hacking-the-tweet-stream-52ed63a0731\">a post<\/a> on Medium called \"Hacking the Tweet Stream,\" advocating for the method and pointing out that it was spreading to not just techies, but celebrities and pro athletes. \n\nAdrian Roselli, a veteran web developer and interface designer, responded to Siegler with with a post titled \"<a href=\"http://blog.adrianroselli.com/2014/12/dont-tweet-pictures-of-text.html\">Don't Tweet Pictures of Text<\/a>,\" pointing out that there are plenty of reasons not to turn textual data into images — not just for the sake of blind people. Converting text to image, Roselli points out, not only creates problems when it comes to resizing and reading out loud, but sets up new roadblocks against translation, small devices, foreign devices, and limited data plans.\n\n\"This isn't an accessibility issue,\" Roselli wrote on his blog in December, \"it's a usability issue and an engagement risk.\" And as it turns out, it's a much more complicated problem than it appears to be.\n\n<a href=\"http://oneshot.link/\">OneShot<\/a> is a new app that actually specializes in screenshorts. Interestingly enough, the company says it is keenly aware of the accessibility problem, but says it is not necessarily on its end. Ian Ownbey, the app's one-man tech team, told BuzzFeed News that OneShot already captures data using OCR (optical character recognition, the same technology used by the blind). But it can't use the data it has.\n\n\"We have the text,\" he said, and suggested that it'd be easy to implant it into the screenshort's metadata, making it machine-readable. So why doesn't OneShot do that?\n\nThe problem, Ownbey said, is that almost all social networks strip metadata from photos as soon as they're uploaded. There are different ways to attach text information to a photo using tags, but without any agreed-upon standard for accessible photo metadata, it's hard for Ownbey to make a coherent case to any social network about which metadata is sacred.\n\nAfter puzzling it over and finding no simple solution, Ownbey has come to think that perhaps the companies creating screen reading software need to get with the times. \"I was actually kind of surprised that screen readers don't have OCR software,\" he told BuzzFeed News. \"I think as we move towards mobile more and more, images for better or for worse are just going to become more pervasive, so it seems like something that will continue cropping up.\"\n\nBut as mainstream media continues to embrace the work-around presented by screenshorts, it's worth remembering it's just that — a work-around, not a solution. And it's working not with Twitter's user interface, but in spite of it. This is why screenshorts will be a bane not just to the blind, but to everyone else as well.\n\nImagine an internet strewn with the data equivalent of dark matter. Convert enough text to images, and the algorithms used by Google, Twitter, Facebook, and any other service will stop working as well. Old screenshorts will soon enough be artifacts of the ancient web— a massive vault of photographs, unlabeled, unsorted, and sourced from every corner of the world.\n\nIt's entirely not hard to imagine a future in which, like looking through a telescope into space, we won't even know what we're not seeing. Google, Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo, Reddit — none of their algorithms would be worth a penny if those indexes didn't contain textual data. Precious, precious SEO — the art form that so many marketers, programmers, and high-level officers have spread as gospel — feeds on plain text, not images. \n\nWhen it comes to the internet, we're all, in a sense, blind. You can't just go on the internet and \"see\" what you're looking for on the horizon. You have to search around until you're actually close enough to \"touch\" it, so to speak. This is why we rely so heavily on the web's equivalent of \"guide dogs\": the search engines, forums, apps, and social networks that help us get where we mean to go — and, not insignificantly, use text to get us there.\n\nIt's easy to assume that people with disabilities live a simpler, less technology-saturated life — but actually, that couldn't be further from the truth. The blind, in particular, are often technological obsessives, early adopters, and in most parts of life must be methodical, thoughtful, and purposeful. We can — we must — cut through the GIFs and photos and bells and whistles to use the web in its simplest and most purely functional form. For that reason, blind internet users are the canary in information technology's coal mine. And now we're emerging, covered in soot, to report that if screenshorts proliferate as they have, they could collapse the web.",
