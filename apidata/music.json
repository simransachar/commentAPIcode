The singles business, which followed the 7-inch disc format into decline after the advent of the LP, was both commercially and artistically lesser &mdash; real artists made albums, the industry said, and for a long time consumers went along.<\/p><p>That dynamic, long challenged by the unbundling of the album on platforms like iTunes, YouTube, and Spotify, was finally put out to pasture last November, when <i>Billboard<\/i> <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/reggieugwu/billboard-to-count-streaming-in-top-albums-chart#.qiBYR6EwXq\">announced<\/a> that it would retool its influential albums chart, the <i>Billboard<\/i> 200, to account for individual streams and track sales for the first time in its history. In a climate where fewer and fewer people seemed interested in buying albums, opting instead to access them on streaming services or download select tracks from iTunes, <i>Billboard<\/i> (where, full disclosure, I was a reporter until a year ago) pivoted to capture more modern forms of consumption, adding up any 10-track downloads from an album, or 1,500 streams &mdash; figures that approximate the revenue of an album sale &mdash; and treating them as good as one.<\/p><p>In the six months since it debuted in early December, the new <i>Billboard<\/i> 200 has eroded the barrier between what were effectively two industries &mdash; one for albums and another for singles &mdash; and legitimized a generation of artists for whom albums have never been more than one of many movable parts that make up a career.<\/p><p>&ldquo;On some level we have to get away from our bias toward the album as the defining product of music,&rdquo; said Jim Roppo, EVP of marketing at Republic Records, home to artists like Ariana Grande and Lorde. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t anymore.&rdquo;<\/p><p>In a fiercely competitive industry where bragging rights and accolades are precious currency, the <i>Billboard<\/i> 200, which debuted in 1956 and was last overhauled in 1991 with the introduction of SoundScan point-of-sale metrics, has long been the yardstick by which all popular artists are measured. For major labels, a high debut on the chart is a vindication of months or years of investment, and provides a critical jolt of momentum in the press and other business dealings. A poor showing on the 200, on the other hand, leaves a painful and visible blemish on everyone involved.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n <p>&ldquo;On some level we have to get away from our bias toward the album as the defining product of music. It isn&rsquo;t anymore.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Changing the formula of the chart has had a material effect on its content, making it more inclusive of albums that spawn hit singles, irrespective of whether those singles inspire album sales. Since the new chart launched in December, there have been three instances where the top-selling album in the country has failed to claim the No. 1 spot, according to <i>Billboard<\/i>, succumbing to other projects with a stronger mix of album sales, track sales, and streams.<br /><\/p><p>The first such instance happened in February, when Taylor Swift&rsquo;s <i>1989<\/i> snagged its <a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6465865/taylor-swift-1989-11th-week-no-1-billboard-200\">11th week at No. 1<\/a> despite being outsold that week by the 53rd volume of the <i>Now That&rsquo;s What I Call Music<\/i> compilation series. The second came a month later, when the <a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6502441/empire-soundtrack-number-one-madonna-number-two\"><i>Empire<\/i> soundtrack bested Madonna&rsquo;s <i>Rebel Heart<\/i><\/a> for the top spot. <i>Rebel Heart<\/i> outsold <i>Empire<\/i> 116,000 to 110,000, but <i>Empire<\/i> had the higher cumulative point total thanks to an additional 17,000 track equivalent albums sold (TEA) and 3,000 streaming equivalent albums (SEA). Madge&rsquo;s album had more modest TEA and SEA sales of 4,000 and 1,000, respectively.<\/p><p>The third and most dramatic instance of track sales and streams helping to trump album sales came in April, when <a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6531833/furious-7-soundtrack-no-1-billboard-200-chart\">the <i>Furious 7<\/i> soundtrack climbed to No. 1<\/a> in its fourth week, fueled by cresting sales of the runaway hit single &ldquo;See You Again&rdquo; by Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth. The better-selling album that week, by a substantial 30,000 copies, was pop-punk band All Time Low&rsquo;s <i>Future Hearts<\/i>; but &ldquo;See You Again,&rdquo; which sold a gargantuan 464,000 downloads, ensured that <i>Furious 7<\/i> blew it out of the water.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n <p>Since the new chart launched, there have been three instances where the top-selling album in the country has failed to claim the No. 1 spot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re All Time Low, or Madonna, or the owners of the <i>Now<\/i> franchise, the new multi-metric ranking system probably feels about as welcome as a blow to the stomach. And, indeed, the revamped chart has its fair share of critics. Rich Bengloff, president of the American Association of Independent Music, a trade group whose members include All Time Low&rsquo;s label Hopeless Records, said the new <i>Billboard<\/i> 200 disadvantages artists who make albums that aren&rsquo;t buoyed by hits.&ldquo;If just one single can overwhelm album sales, then it becomes a hits-driven chart, when it&rsquo;s supposed to reflect bodies of work,&rdquo; said Bengloff. &ldquo;We already have a singles chart.&rdquo;<\/p><p>But <i>Billboard<\/i> argues that including track sales and streams in the <i>Billboard<\/i> 200 makes for a more accurate portrayal of what albums are truly popular in the digital age. Only counting album sales (down 11% last year, 8% the year before) is an increasingly myopic way of looking at music consumption as streaming activity has exploded &mdash; a trend that may be dramatically hastened with the <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/reggieugwu/can-apple-make-listening-to-music-easy-again#.bqkAoRQN4r\">arrival of Apple Music<\/a>. And since streaming services currently collect only bulk data, and don&rsquo;t track how many songs a person streams from an album, there&rsquo;s no perfect analog to an album sale in the streaming world. Whether the listener is interested in venturing beyond the song they heard on the radio or a blog is moot &mdash; all that counts is that they&rsquo;re listening.<\/p><p>&ldquo;Yes, there are albums that benefit more than others from the inclusion of track-equivalent albums and streaming-equivalent albums on the chart,&rdquo; said Keith Caulfield, associate director of charts at <i>Billboard<\/i> and manager of the <i>Billboard<\/i> 200. &ldquo;But I think those really are the most popular albums because of the hits that they&rsquo;re generating and because of the way people are consuming them and listening to them and buying them.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-06/3/22/enhanced/webdr13/longform-1031-1433384569-1.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"150\" alt=\"\" /><\/p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Official Charts Company.<\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>In the U.K., handwringing over the inability to distinguish whether users of streaming services were really listening to albums or just the hits prompted the Official Charts Company to devise <a href=\"http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/uk-s-official-albums-chart-to-include-streaming-data-for-first-time__8012/\">a complex new formula<\/a> for its own album rankings, announced in February. The formula, cited favorably by Bengloff and his cohorts, effectively neutralizes the impact of albums with one or two songs that are wildly more popular than the others. While he called the OCC&rsquo;s methodology &ldquo;interesting,&rdquo; Caulfield said <i>Billboard<\/i> has no plans to take similar methods with its own chart.<\/p><p>Though tracks and streams now count toward the <i>Billboard<\/i> 200, the upper ranks of the chart have still mostly resisted primarily singles-driven interlopers &mdash; making cases like the <i>Furious 7<\/i> soundtrack exceptional. Florence and the Machine, this week&rsquo;s No. 1 with <i>How Big How Blue How Beautiful<\/i>, and blues rockers Alabama Shakes, who had a No. 1 debut in April, won the field handily despite earning negligible points from tracks and streams, proving that, for now at least, convincing lots of people to buy your whole album remains the most assured route to No. 1.<\/p><p>The further down the chart you go, however, the more progressive things get. On May 16, dance-pop newcomers Walk the Moon landed at No. 14 on the chart with fully 67% the point total for their debut album, <i>Talking Is Hard<\/i>, coming from downloads of just one song &mdash; breakout single &ldquo;Shut Up and Dance.&rdquo; On the pure album sales chart that week, launched concurrently with the new <i>Billboard<\/i> 200, <i>Talking Is Hard<\/i> was a lowly No. 69.<\/p><p>And this week, Jason Derulo &mdash; a singles artist if there ever was one &mdash; enjoys a marathon 58th week on the <i>Billboard<\/i> 200 for his 2013 album <i>Talk Dirty<\/i>, which came in at No. 127 due to steady streams of hits like &ldquo;Wiggle&rdquo; and the album&rsquo;s title track. Derulo&rsquo;s similarly hit-filled debut album, 2010&rsquo;s <i>Jason Derulo<\/i>, lasted a little more than half as long on the old chart.<\/p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a bad thing for the 200 to be more dynamic,&rdquo; said Josh Deutsch, founder of Downtown Records, whose roster includes Cold War Kids and Santigold. &ldquo;If you sell 100,000 copies of one track, and stream 300,000 copies of another track, and album sales are negligible, it&rsquo;s all still revenue.&rdquo;<\/p><p>The particulars of how <i>Billboard<\/i> defines the equivalent of an album sale may change in the future. A number of label executives I spoke with said they expected the figure for a Streaming Equivalent Album, 1,500 streams, might come down as streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music achieve greater scale, for instance; or that perhaps <i>Billboard<\/i> would assign different values for free and paid services, which trigger different levels of royalty payments.<\/p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re always looking at how we can make the charts better,&rdquo; said Caulfield when I relayed those suggestions. &ldquo;Right now, we think this is the best recipe.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n\n <p><small><\/small><\/p>",

Working with a staff of more than 50, it took Myrvhold more than five years to complete the book. But from the moment of its conception Modernist Cuisine was a target for the pirates, and in 2012, on the underground torrent site what.cd, a user named \"buffguy\" uploaded a complete PDF copy. Included with the post was a note, detailing the 200 hours it had taken to scan, edit and organize all two thousand plus pages. Soon, the pirated version Modernist Cuisine was posted to numerous other torrent sites, including a dedicated cookbook piracy concern called deli.sh.\n\nBut the rip of Modernist Cuisine wasn't just about food. For years, the pirates had been fighting a guerilla battle against the intellectual property enforcers, and Myrvhold was a tempting target: in addition to his work as a chef, he is also the founder of Intellectual Ventures, a business which buys up underused patent portfolios then shakes down large corporations by threatening infringement lawsuits on their behalf. (Myrvhold claims this unpopular \"patent-trolling\" spurs innovation; he's even argued that gastronomy would advance more quickly if chefs were permitted to copyright their recipes.) \n\nRight or wrong, the boundaries of intellectual property remain bitterly contested, and, with further editions of Modernist Cuisine in the works, Myrvhold can expect his work to be pirated again.",

Later, the duo joined Mick and the McVies for the second (or maybe third) incarnation of Fleetwood Mac, and if you care at all about music, you know the rest of the story. But this forgotten pressing was never officially digitized, not even on CD. You can only hear it now, because somewhere, once, some vinyl nerd ran it through an analog-to-digital converter, copyright be damned.",

                     "description": "<b>Pirated?<\/b> Yes.\n\nIn his unforgettable short story \"Pierre Menard, the Author of Don Quixote,\" the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges wrote of a recently-deceased novelist named Pierre Menard, who, by immersing himself in the culture and language of medieval Spain, somehow managed to re-write Don Quixote from scratch without referring to the primary text. Menard's Quixote was identical to Cervantes'—\"word for word and line for line\"—but represented, in the author's estimation, an entirely original work.\n\nBorges was obsessed with such questions of authenticity and translation, and when he began translating his own work into English in the late 1960s, he took a similarly unusual approach: in daily sessions with Norman Thomas di Giovanni, a graduate student at Harvard University, Borges re-wrote his own work from scratch. As the two explained in the preface to the 1971 collection The Aleph and Other Stories: \n\n\"We do not consider English and Spanish as compounded sets of easily interchangeable synonyms… English, for example, is far more physical than Spanish. We have therefore shunned the dictionary as much as possible and done our best to rethink every sentence in English words.\"\n\nLike Menard's Quixote, these \"translations\" were in fact unique literary re-imaginings. But, after Borges' died in 1986, his widow rescinded the copyrights for these works. Seeking to recoup the 50% share of licensing revenue that di Giovanni earned from the burgeoning English-language market for Borges, la viuda cut herself a more favorable deal with a different translator, and gradually di Giovanni's wonderful \"physical\" translations fell out of print. \n\nBy the start of the 21st century, literary scholars were discussing Borges alongside Kafka, Beckett and Proust, and Di Giovanni first editions were selling for thousands of dollars. Online, a loose confederation of comp-lit Internet pirates started tracking them down one by one. In 2013, after spending years sourcing and scanning the books, a user by the name of \"dontsurf\" uploaded the complete di Giovanni translations to the private torrent tracker what.cd—a Menard-like masterwork of copyright infringement that would surely have impressed even the Argentine himself.",

Marclay then logged the exact times shown in the clips, and, over the next three years, stitched these images into a 24-hour movie that was itself a meta-clock that told perfect time. Walk into the installation at precisely 10:04 P.M., for example, and you'd find yourself watching the scene from Back to the Future where the lightning hits the bell tower. Walk in at noon, and you'd get High Noon. \n\nAs The Clock is a montage of appropriated images, it's a natural target for pirates. But in 2011, a copy of the artwork sold for nearly half a million dollars, and who has that kind of money? Recently, members of the underground torrent site Pass the Popcorn proposed an alternative approach: if The Clock can't easily be pirated, perhaps it can be remade. By crowdsourcing a list of every single one of The Clock's reference materials, then sourcing that footage from already pirated material, it might be possible to create an identical version of The Clock without ever having access to the original. \n\nThe project remains ongoing.",

Working in teams, it took the torrenters just a fraction of that time to rip all 104 CDs from this audiobook collection and post them to the Net. But the Potterverse is a dangerous place, haunted by Werewolves, Dementors, Boggarts… and J.K. Rowling's formidable copyright lawyers. When this audiobook was first posted to the private torrent site Oink's Pink Palace in 2007, lawyers working for Rowling exposed Alan Ellis, the site's proprietor, and reported him to the British authorities. Soon Oink was shut down, and Ellis arrested for conspiracy to defraud. But a good pirate never stays locked up for long: in 2010, Ellis was declared innocent, and today, links to the complete audiobook can be found at dozens of sites.",

The rap collective is seeking a seven-figure price for the album, and has contracted the online auction house Paddle8 to manage the sale. The buyer will receive the only existing physical pressing of Once Upon a Time in Shaolin: two CDs, cased in a hand-carved silver box, further nested inside a velvet-lined cedar box, bound in leather. \n\nThe buyer is most likely to be a man, under 40, with a lot of disposable income and an emotional investment in the Wu-Tang myth—perhaps a tech billionaire, or a Qatari prince. Once the deal closes, he is free to do whatever he wishes with the discs. He can hoard them forever; he can release the tracks one by one over a period of years; he can upload them all to Soundcloud at once. \"We've received several interesting, legitimate offers over the past few months,\" says Paddle8's Sarah Goulet, \"Including one particularly interesting bid. I think you could see a sale sometime in the three or four weeks.\"\n\nSo who is he? Will he leak it?\n\n\"I can't get into specifics,\" says Goulet.\n\nWill the buyer at least identify himself after the sale?\n\n\"Maybe. The other collectors, from day one, never wanted to be identified. But this particular buyer, possibly. It could be an interesting conversation.\"\n\nSean Parker?\n\n\"No. And that's your last guess.\"",

All my critiques go out the window when Trey looks over his shoulder and smiles at the audience with that perfect smile of his before exiting the stage. Gets me every time.\n34. The in-between sets DJ is now doing the obligatory Spanish music portion (see reggae rule).\n35. And wouldn't you guess it, \"Bitch Better Have My Money\" gets played yet again.\n36.

Now he's performing old music from when I used to love him with my entire heart.\n44. WE WERE ROOTNG FOR YOU CHRIS! WE WERE ALL ROOTING FOR YOU!\n45. Sorry, I don't know why I allow him to get me this emotional. \n46. Chris Brown is that ex-boyfriend you'll always love but know will never do right by you.\n47. OMG is that 50 Cent!? Is that G-Unit?! Is G-Unit actually back together on stage right now?!",
