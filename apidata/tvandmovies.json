Knowing there's this kind of bomb we're going to drop is exciting, but that's a rare time when I think about the viewers.\"\n\nStrong's only goal is for the show to focus on what it did well in Season 1. \"If you're trying to think about how we can outdo ourselves or do this and do that, then I think we would screw up the show,\" he explained. \"I love that we're taking a genre that's a very mainstream genre and telling a very subversive story within that genre — tackling homophobia and race relations and bipolar disorder. I love the epic <i>Game of Thrones<\/i>-like battle that exists in this show … I just like good stories and I think we're telling a good story.\"",

                     "description": "When I wrote the cold open for the <i>Veronica Mars<\/i> pilot script, I had two missions. First, make it scream noir. I wanted to get as many genre-defining elements into the opening as possible: a night scene, neon reflecting off wet pavement, a seedy location, a world-weary misanthropic Raymond Chandler–esque voiceover, disjointed time, a private detective at the center of the show. My second mission was to define Veronica. I wanted people to realize that this 17-year-old had seen some real shit. We wouldn't know she'd been raped or that her best friend had been murdered until later in the episode, but it was important to me that she sounded like someone you don't mess with. I wanted to get as far away from Nancy Drew as possible. \n \nThe director of the pilot, Mark Piznarski, shot the hell out of this opening sequence. It was everything I wanted it to be, but well into the editing process of the pilot, the word came down from the network that \"a high school show should open on the high school,\" so instead of this opening, we ended up with a shot of Veronica driving up to a high school and getting out of her car. I had about 10 seconds of footage to distill the concept of the show, so instead of the Raymond Chandler–esque voiceover I'd originally written, Veronica said something like, \"This is where I go to school. Other kids work at the Gap and Taco Bell. Not me. I'm a private eye.\"\n \nLopping off that opening hurt me badly. If there's any comfort, I did get to use my original opening on the DVDs and digital downloads.",

Being a writer and a mother, I would absolutely say that TV writing is like having a kid — you get a small idea, you gestate it, nurture it from your insides, then sweat and cry as you bring it out of your body (onto the page) for the world to see.\n\nAnd judge. And tell you how it should be different, or better, or more like what they expected.\n\nBut that's not the answer to your question.\n\nI'm not sure I've written my favorite thing yet; but the piece of writing closest to my heart is probably my original outline for <i>Power<\/i>, before anyone had seen it at all. It represented Ghost as he was originally conceived, white-knuckling a drinking problem while going to AA meetings and still being a half-time drug dealer, half-time legit nightclub owner. It was a bit of a stream-of-conscious fever dream, before the algebra of creating a comprehensible draft or a produceable script came into play. Along the way, self-doubt would creep up, but I pushed past it — I knew the story I wanted to tell. The finished outline was not only evidence of the show <i>Power<\/i> could become, but evidence of belief in myself as a writer. When I have hard decisions to make plotting the series, I go back to that outline — not only to revisit the fundamentals of the show, but also for the reminder that I can trust myself to cross the finish line.",

But I know exactly where this idea came from...\n\nThe final scene of \"Through the Looking Glass\" — the third season finale of <i>Lost<\/i> — was stolen from the movie <i>Saw 2<\/i>. \n\nIf you have not seen <i>Saw 2<\/i>, all you need to know is that Donnie Wahlberg is in it and that the twist at the end involves tricking the audience into thinking they're watching something unfold in present time, when in fact, it is unfolding in the PAST. Also, Donnie Wahlberg is in it. Did I say that already? \n\nANYWAY.\n\nCarlton (my co-writer) and I had just finally won the battle to have ABC announce an end date to the show (albeit three years out), which finally allowed us to break from the monotony of character flashbacks (we had one that explained where Sayid had his hair styled all lined up) and launch into flash-FORWARDS. But the divine inspiration of <i>Saw 2<\/i> led us to the inevitable conclusion that the best way to do this would be to make our first flash-forward LOOK like yet another flashback. And then, in the final scene, we drop the hammer. Boom. You're in the FUTURE, BITCHES!!! TAKE THAT, DONNIE WAHLBERG!\n\nWriting that scene — the one where Jack waits on the outskirts of LAX as a car pulls up... the door opens... and out steps KATE — was awesome. My process is riddled with doubt and self-loathing, but this was one of the rare instances where I felt like I was doing something undeniably great. I felt like I had been crouched down in the darkness of someone's apartment with all my best friends (the writers) waiting to shout out SURPRISE to our unexpected birthday boy/girl (the audience) — and I KNEW they'd be thrilled when we did.\n\nAnd by time Jack was shouting, \"WE HAVE TO GO BAAAAAAAACK!\" (yes, I added all those extra A's in the script) and I typed SMASH TO BLACK, my eyes were wet. I was inside the thing... feeling what these characters were feeling... knowing we were, at long last, working toward an actual ENDING now. And finally...for one fleeting moment...\n\nI felt peace.",

There was a feature film in the works, a second TV show (<i>Millennium<\/i>), and right about Christmastime the usual desperation to go somewhere to relax. Typically that meant writing without the phones ringing, and this holiday was no different. My wife and I had gone to Hawaii, where the goal was wake early to rewrite Episode 14, plot the movie with Frank Spotnitz in the afternoon and try to enjoy ourselves otherwise. The best laid plans. My wife got sick, the weather was marginal, and the rewrite proved to be harder than anticipated — a delicate plot line involving Gillian Anderson's character and her cancer. \n \nFlash forward to Christmas a year later. The movie had been shot and was in post, Episode 14 was a fading memory, and the usual desperation to get to someplace warm, which was Costa Rica. We were bobbing in the pool when a teenage girl vacationing with her parents said she recognized me, which was surprising enough, and then recited Scully's long opening monologue from Episode 14.\n \nIn the '90s, before internet feedback was ubiquitous and instantaneous, we were lucky to read early chatroom conversations and find time to open actual mail. We watched the show in our homes like everyone else, at a curious remove from the millions of viewers we were told were watching with us. To hear these words spoken by heart was the most unexpected gift. The monologue may not be the best thing I've ever written, but it remains among the most salient memories over the 202 episodes.",

Although there are some that are funnier, some that have bigger aha moments, some that have bigger cliffhangers, this one means the most because it proved (both to me, and I think to the audience) that this show had legs beyond its initial premise. Because our pilot was well received, I felt a lot of pressure to deliver in episode 102 — especially because most reviews ended with the question: Will they be able to sustain this tone? And I wanted the answer to be yes! \n\nIt also has one of my favorite scenes: Jane breaking down to her mother, on the porch, about how she is not ready to be a mom. I knew it was really important to slow the show down and give Jane the space to have a real, grounded, emotional response to this accidental insemination. But what I could not have anticipated was Gina Rodriguez's performance. So emotional, so vulnerable, so real, so heartbreaking... she was so extraordinary we didn't cut away once.",

Any given line I pat myself on the back for here could turn out to have been at least partly the work of someone else in our room. \n \nThat said, I will venture to take some special pride in our \"15 Pancakes\" and \"30 Pancakes\" segments. At the point at which it was decided that Forrest, in the same episode, would have to review both what it's like to eat 15 pancakes and what it's like to eat 30 pancakes, I volunteered to take the first pass at those scripts. Because the scope of what he'd be doing was so small and because it would all come down to what this character said about the experience, writing this segment seemed like a good opportunity to demonstrate what I thought Forrest's voice should sound like, how banal and overanalytical he could be, how focused he could get on minutiae, how seriously he would take even something this incredibly stupid. \n\nAnd the idea that this moronic stunt would be the first assignment that Forrest felt he could not complete, the first time he lost faith in himself and his project, was really funny to me. I'm sure I can't take full credit for the premise that Forrest is defeated by 15 pancakes and then triumphs over 30, but writing it was great great fun and I am incredibly gratified by how many people tell me they love the line \"These pancakes couldn't kill me because I was already dead.\" I think I wrote that.

It was my first time out of the gate and I was already a producer on the show so it would have been really embarrassing if people didn't like the script I wrote. I'd been given this song my our music supervisor Chris Mollere when he interviewed for the job. He gave me a whole album actually; it was Matt Kearney's first album and there's this song called \"All I Need\" that's the most beautiful song I'd ever heard in my entire life. \n\nAnd so I listened to that song on, basically, constant loop while I was writing my first episode of television and the end of the episode, I wrote to that song, intending on using that song, so when we went and shot the episode, I played that song while we were shooting — it's the final shot of Kyle throwing the drawing he painted of the girl he had a crush on into the pool so it would melt because he just realized she had a boyfriend. His little heart was broken. \n\nSo I played the song while we were shooting that scene and then we used the song in the cut and for whatever reason it's always been my favorite moment; I think because it was everything I envisioned everything I wanted it to be it was and because it was my first time. And the song placement was so gorgeous and it was so powerful and worked so well that I felt great about it. And just sweet little Matt Dallas and his sad face standing by the edge of the pool realizing he's not going to get the girl as Matt Kearney's beautiful song is playing. It's just the greatest.",

It proved that in a comedy we can pause for a real moment and the audience will not just accept it but enjoy the emotion. It was also the first time I got to fully execute and express the tone in which I always wanted the show to be. In my mind <i>Girlfriends<\/i> was supposed to be a single-camera comedy, but I had a multicamera budget as well as the network's expectation that those characters belonged without a fourth wall.\n\nI knew they were far bigger than that, they deserved a real location for their real life obstacles and that the storytelling deserved the visual depth that the location, hundreds of extras, and great performances allowed. From that moment on, <i>Girlfriends<\/i> vacillated between laughter and tears, sometimes per episode, and like the moment when Joan and Toni made up, we laughed and cried in the same scene.",

I'd been generously given a script to write and a character called the Overdancer, created in a previous episode by Becky Hartman Edwards, was making an appearance. He was a regular on <i>American Bandstand<\/i> and Meg — our lead, played by Brittany Snow — had the unfortunate distinction of having to dance with him. I needed to come up with a weird dance for him to do and I thought back to a dance that my nine roommates and I always used to do in college: The Shower Dance. \n\nIt's where one person gets in the middle and pretends to take a shower, while everyone around them holds their arms up, wiggles their fingers, and pretends to be the water. On the day we shot it, I had to go down to set to show Britt, the Overdancer, and the choreographer, Michelle, exactly how the dance was supposed to be done. When they did the first take, the Overdancer started yelling at Meg to \"Be the water! Be the water!\" as she looked on confused and uncomfortable and as soon as the director, Randy Zisk, yelled cut, the entire crew broke into applause. It was such a cool moment because it felt like something unique to my life had been infused into this episode and made better by everyone participating... and from that episode, I was placed on the staff of <i>American Dreams<\/i> — my first full-time writing job.",

It's when the hooker Betty is sitting with Masters, and Masters is shocked and confused to learn that women fake orgasms, and he says, very unnerved, \"Is faking an orgasm a common practice amongst prostitutes?\" And Betty replies, \"It's a common practice amongst anyone with a twat.\"\n\nSo I like Betty's line a lot. Not only was it an irreverent line, it also had a lot of truth behind it, which always pleases me, but also so many of our cast and crew at the time, including director John Madden and star Michael Sheen, are British. And in Britain, calling someone a \"twat\" is a huge insult and considered about as vulgar as you can get. So it was greeted with a fair amount of shock on the set, and it always seems to get a laugh when we screen that scene.",

So I'd like to talk about two benchmark experiences that serve as bookends, sort of... My hopes were high for the first script I ever had produced. It was a two-hour pilot based on the Archie comic book characters. I was the seventh writer, and NBC's option was about to expire, and I was a newbie writer hired as a hail mary. \n\nI wrote a weird, subversive black comedy. Veronica's father inadvertently orders his driver to assassinate Archie. Reggie owned a health club that was firebombed. Jughead was a tortured shrink. It was funny, I thought, and strange and it got ordered to production within days of me handing it in. I thought this was amazing, I had high hopes...but no power. A very traditional director was hired who was best known for TV movies starring Kenny Rogers. He didn't get the tone, and the only cut I ever saw had all the blackly comedic material excised. The end result was bland and probably not very good. \n\nNow speed forward more than a decade to me starting on <i>24<\/i> in its second year, and writing my first episode, wherein Jack Bauer seemingly has a terrorist's child killed in front of him. So, just dark, dark, dark as hell. Arguably darker than the show had gone before. And of course not even remotely funny. I won the Writer's Guild Award for Best Drama Script for that episode, forever making it as a benchmark in my career. I like to think my deep down, DNA level, machine code voice as a writer is located somewhere between these two poles. An absurd black comedy about (formerly) wholesome comic book characters. And a dead serious, dark as you can get, drama about a tortured hero forced to do terrible things in order to save lives. Both subversive in their own ways, with decidedly different results.",

An early episode I wrote for <i>Roseanne<\/i> in which John Goodman's character Dan was in financial trouble and had to swallow his pride and ask his sister-in-law Jackie (Laurie Metcalf) for a loan. This scene was memorable for several reasons. First, it taught me that comedy could be made to sit comfortably alongside very difficult emotions (a lesson I later employed on the <i>Grace Under Fire<\/i> pilot, and lately on <i>Mom<\/i>). Second, I had experienced the embarrassment and shame associated with having to go to a family member for a loan, so this was a personal piece of writing. And lastly, I was just stunned that actors of the caliber of Goodman and Metcalf were actually saying the words I wrote and making them come alive beyond my expectations.",

It's tough to choose a favorite so I will tell you about my most recent...\n\nWhen I wrote Beckett's performance review scene in the <i>Castle<\/i> Season 7 finale, it was an immersion into Kate Beckett's entire journey. The moments in the scene encompass seven seasons of near death experiences, ambitions, passion, and confidence. Stana Katic's performance stands out as one of her best in a long list of stunners. Under attack at what she believes to be a performance review by her superiors, Beckett rises up against the people challenging her right to be a cop and embodies the character's strength, conviction and personal truths. Every time I watch it, I'm moved by all of the actors performances, the way the scene came together and how it was elevated by the talented folks on our show. It has become for me and everyone who participated in creating it, one of those moments of grace.",

He invites a friend over and gives him a tour of the place. Much of the dialogue is about microphones, drums, and the recording equipment used on the album <i>Pet Sounds<\/i>. That's basically it. It is inspired by a friend of mine named Woody, who once gave me a tour of his home recording studio. I just love the fact that there is a sketch about microphones and recording engineers that exists out there on TV and online.

Without giving too much away, in the first episode of the second season of <i>Playing House<\/i>, our characters, Maggie and Emma, get caught breaking into Mark (Keegan Michael Key) and Tina, aka Bird Bones' (Lindsay Sloane) house and they almost have sex on top of us. Weirdly enough, we were inspired by the scene in <i>The Great Muppet Caper<\/i> when a ragtag bunch of muppets break in to steal back the Baseball Diamond. I'm Miss Piggy to Lennon's Kermit. \n\nWe improvise all the parts in order to write our first draft of the script and watching Lennon improvise as Keegan is one of my greatest joys in life. When we're breaking episodes, we often start by coming up with scenes that we want to see, what would make us laugh, and go from there. Often, it's a physical comedy bit, with the girls getting into a real scrape and then we ground it in the real emotions that the characters are going through. Something I love about this show and this scene specifically is that no matter what insane things they may go through, at the end of the day, these are people that truly love each other. Oh, and we had to teach a dog how to hump a puppet. Which, weirdly enough, was NOT inspired by <i>The Great Muppet Caper<\/i>. So, there's that...",

If Michael Jordan is your all-time favorite basketball player, you might be a little black-ish. If Jay Z is your favorite musician, you're definitely, definitely a little black-ish. But that's a good thing. At least I think it is. Because in the grand scheme of things, in this melting pot called American, aren't we all? \n\nAnd before you ask… \"No.\" I'm not saying this just because I created the new ABC comedy, <i>Black-ish<\/i>. In fact, when I decided to do <i>Black-ish<\/i> I didn't even have a title. Instead I went about it in the novel and contrite way of beginning with an idea, based on my life, and writing that idea in the most truthful, humorous, and, hopefully, appealing way I could. See I'm a TV writer, my biracial wife Rainbow, is an anesthesiologist and, although we're doing OK now, we're both from what is commonly referred to as \"the hood.\" In stark contrast, we've raised our five kids in feral cat–free, stray pit bull terrier–less neighborhoods that I would call utopia…or at least nirvana. And although the predominantly negro-free schools they attend do have a Jim Crow–like air of Pine-Sol and mayonnaise to them, they are, in fact, the schools that my wife and I (but mostly her) fought very hard to put them into — even at the sake of my own sports car or built-in home theater room. We wanted to give them the best, as any parent would, and for what it's worth, those were the schools that kept coming up whenever we googled \"Best schools.\" \n\nBesides, the racial landscape of America has shifted drastically in the last three decades. The hopeful, inspiring, idealistic, tableau that <i>The Cosby Show<\/i> gave us has been realized. In fact, now with a black president, that shit is sorta over! The idea of an upwardly mobile black family has become a day-to-day part of our societal fabric and, subsequently, a delicious and permanent chocolaty layer of the cake of Americana. So much so that the idea that I had when I was growing up, of what it meant to \"be black,\" is becoming passé. Mark my words, we're living in \"the last days of disco\" where it's still cool to be black. Basically, in our effort to assimilate… Guess what? We've assimilated! At least, a little bit. I guess a lot of people would say that's a good thing, right? <i>I guess.<\/i> \n\nIf I'm being honest, I sorta wanna go back to those good ol' days of being black. You know, the ones when you said \"big butts\" and Kim K. and J.Lo weren't the first names that fell out of people's mouths. The days when black dudes went to the club and actually danced instead of standing around watching Asian guys light up the linoleum. The days when I wasn't scared to start a fight with a white guy because I was scared he could be a MMA wannabe, looking to test out his YouTube fighting skills on an unsuspecting victim who looked exactly like me. \n\nNow don't get me wrong. I love my life. And I love the societal strides we've made, yet am also keenly aware that we still have tons of injustices and wrongs that need to be righted. But there's no denying that things have changed — in the last decade in particular. My kids are living in a world of homogeneity that causes me a raised eyebrow on the daily. Who are these strange, little people I'm raising who are playing soccer and listening to Macklemore? And that's what the show I wrote is all about. It's not exclusionary. In fact, it's the ultimate love letter to inclusion! It's about identity and a father's struggle with it, for himself and, most importantly, his kids. Kids that are living in a world where German-born Dirk Nowitzki kind of has a \"BLACK-ISH\" game, where Justin Timberlake and Robin Thicke sound a lot \"BLACK-ISH.\" A world where their own personal mores, habits, interests, and behaviors so far from the stuff that he knew, growing up in \"the hood,\" that it seems his kids are becoming 'BLACK-ISH.\" And that's the beauty of the show: Our society evolving to reach a really interesting convergence of behaviors where black culture has penetrated enough of the mainstream that everyone is a little \"BLACK-ISH,\" and the idea of what it means to be \"black\" has morphed out of it's debilitating and suffocating box, with fewer boundaries and limitless ceilings. So in the end, being \"BLACK-ISH\" is really just being \"AMERICAN,\" and that's a good thing… I guess.",

It's been frozen since the cursed town came into existence years earlier. As he stares at it in the wake of the arrival of his mother, Emma, the clock finally comes alive and ticks. Henry smiles. That small moment encapsulated everything the show was about and still is to this day: hope. \n\nWe consciously decided that we didn't want to end the pilot on a traditional \"cliffhanger\" or \"twist\" — we hoped there were enough turns in the story to have engaged the audience already. Instead we really wanted to focus on the \"feeling\" we hoped to leave with our viewers. In many ways it was a direct descendant of a moment we wrote years earlier on <i>Lost<\/i>, in an episode where Hurley found an old VW Bus on the island. The story simply became about starting the van — but it was really about hope. The catharsis Hurley felt, and by extension the audience felt, when the impossible happened and the ancient van revved to life was an important epiphany for us as writers. Since then we've always strived to find a well of emotion in the simplest of moments. For <i>Once Upon a Time<\/i>, it has now become our ongoing mantra to keep the show unabashedly hopeful and uncyncial. To always search in every episode for what we call our \"clock tick\" moment.",

I remember filming that pilot was so relaxing – between takes and camera setups, I was reading <i>World War Z<\/i> and just relaxing and enjoying the experience without the dread of \"Oh my god, is this going to cut together? Is this good enough?\" None of that. It was all alleviated by Barry's confidence in the world and also his energy and his own wit.

The priest's legal defense was that he was following guidance he received from God through prayer. What made this defense intriguing is that it wasn't an insanity plea. The priest wasn't claiming that he heard God's voice or anything irrational, merely that he prayed for guidance — as one does — and received it and acted on it.

At the end of episode 312 — \"Lunar Ellipse\" — Scott tells his mentor, Dr. Deaton, in voiceover, how the recent events have left a dark feeling over him, reminding him of a quote from the first day of English class. Scott says, \"When I feel it, it's like I'm 'looking into the heart of an immense darkness.'\"\n\nDeaton asks him, \"What do you do instead?\"\n\nScott replies, \"I look for my friends.\" And then we see Stiles step through the doors of the school to put an arm around him. They smile at each other, noticing the rest of their friends, seeing that life actually has immense possibility ahead of them. And reminding our passionate viewers that at its heart, <i>Teen Wolf<\/i> is a show about friendship.",

And when it came time to write the scene where Maggie is pushing and she doesn't think she can do it anymore, that she's just not strong enough — which is a moment many women face during labor — we didn't want to shy away from the intensity of the moment. \n\nMaggie's best friend, Emma, steps in to remind her that she's stronger than she knows and that she can indeed do this, in what is probably the most emotional moment in any of our shows. I was really proud to be able to balance the drama of this scene with the comedy. Everything came full circle when, in real life, Jessica also gave birth to a beautiful baby girl — in an eerily similar way to the TV birth we had just written.",

The plot of the pilot episode involved the escape of a genetically enhanced, superintelligent western lowland gorilla from a lab environment and into the underworld of a major city…where he promptly establishes himself as a mafia kingpin and proceeds to take over all of the local rackets. The climactic showdown between our heroes and the villainous ape took place in the gorilla's Tony Soprano-like place of \"legitimate business\"...a strip club called \"Jane's Coconuts.\" \n\nFor one bright and shining day, I got to watch as a team of over a hundred artists and craftspeople — including a quartet of puppet technicians and performers from Jim Henson's Creature Shop (the gorilla suit was one of their creations) — made this unlikely scene come to life. As the scene ramps up, the gorilla, who sits at a table by the stage wearing a red track suit and gold chains (the tailor who custom-made the wardrobe had previously tailored a very similar garment for a Seagal movie, and told me that, strangely, the dimensions were not all that different) bossing his minions around, shouts \"and you... get me a banana!\" to the exotic dancer on the stage — right before brandishing an M-16A1 machine gun at the heroes and screaming, \"SAY HELLO TO MY LITTLE FRIEND!\"\n\nThat the scene I just described exists on a DVD set that people can buy and watch... that it is not — by a wide margin — the strangest thing we got to put on the air as part of the <i>The Middleman<\/i> TV series... and that I am able to write the sentences above as anything other than the word-salad rantings of a deranged mind are proof of two things. \n\nOne, there is no better job in the world than getting to create and run your own show, and, two, I may just be the luckiest guy who ever lived.",

Usually, we shoot an episode over five days. This one took more than TWO months. The writers began calling it my <i>Apocalypse Now<\/i>. It was a true labor of love where we re-created sets, shots and even got Charlie Sheen to slip on his old leather jacket to reprise his role. \n\nAt one point he looked around the police station set, shook his head and said, \"This is fucking weird, man!\" And it was. Weird, surreal, funny, touching, glorious… everything the movie was to me. Some of my best memories were watching <i>Ferris Bueller<\/i> with my big brother Barry and quoting the lines with him. I still get chills every time I see that final shot of TV Barry on the float singing \"Twist and Shout\" with the voice that says — \"We all wanted to live the movies we loved growing up… and on that magical night my brother really did.\"",

For three episodes in a row, I wrote what I thought was a wrenching scene for Barnett. For three episodes in a row, Mahoney found a way for Barnett to stay in denial. It seemed the more I threw at Walter, the more Mahoney resisted. I had, and have, so much respect for Mahoney that I knew he was right, and I hadn't found the real key to his character. Even so, I was getting anxious. I began to feel the way a shrink must feel when he can't get through to a patient. I tried one last time. \n \nI gave Dr. Weston a very direct monologue about how Barnett's character had split off from himself when he was a child. About how that little boy was waiting for Barnett to rescue him, still, after all these years. We did a quick read-through, and afterward Mahoney asked me a dozen questions. It seemed like something struck a chord. \n\nDirector Paris Barclay and I and Gabriel all agreed we should start coverage with one camera, in close-up, on Walter. The other camera operator was told to be prepared for anything. Mahoney started the scene, and something happened. His character's lifetime of denial started to shatter before our eyes. Gabriel sensed it, and as Walter broke, he got out of his chair (which he almost NEVER did) and went to Walter. Walter began sobbing, reached out, and clutched Dr. Weston. CEO Walter Barnett became the little boy who was cast aside so many years ago. They got through the scene somehow, and the entire crew burst into applause. For me, the struggle in television is to stay organic and collaborative and in the moment. It's a great feeling when it all just clicks into place.",

As the climax of this burgeoning love story between two damaged narcissists, it needed to thread a very fine needle in order to make the audience root for our heroes while avoiding the pitfalls of rom-com cliché. The scene is a split-screen phone call between Jimmy (Chris Geere), who cannot find the correct porn video he needs to masturbate himself to sleep to, and Gretchen (Aya Cash), who has just slept with the A-list director she's in love with but who, in turn, treats her like crap, and now finds herself pathetically sitting in his bathtub doing cocaine, wondering what her life has come to. \n\nAfter admitting she stole his car earlier that day after their first fight, the climatic moment of the scene comes when Gretchen blurts out to Jimmy a potentially shameful admission from her past — that she set fire to her high school to get out of a math test. The admission is a bit of a test itself, and indeed she expects disapproval. Instead, Jimmy giggles and says, \"That's genius,\" and then moves on, as narcissists do, to talking about himself. \n\nIn that moment, Gretchen hears that her dark parts are not judged by this dude, nay, they are accepted. And it is that fear of being judged that, to me, is the scariest part of giving yourself to another. And in Jimmy laughing at the confession which minutes earlier her director bedmate found horrifying, he reveals himself to be Gretchen's soul mate — though she'd punch you if you said that to her. The scene ends with Gretchen similarly not judging Jimmy (for having a foot fetish), but indeed helping him awkwardly through a fantasy, proving that phone sex can be romantic, if the heart, no matter how cynical, dark, and damaged, is in the right place.",

                     "description": "I've been writing TV a long time — 10 years in Canada before I moved to L.A. in 1998 — so when I pause to define my favorite moment I have to grab my head and really think, because defining a single example is a terrible insult to a ton of actors I've worked with over the years who have delighted me by making it appear that I can write.\n\nI've come to realize that how much I like something I wrote is directly proportionate to how much the actor delivering made the writing his or her own. It appears to me that this is most likely to happen when the content resonates with something from the actor's own life or psyche, but I could be wrong. What actors do is miraculous magic to me, unfathomable and unknowable and mysterious. \n\nOne of my favorite moments was on <i>Bones<\/i> when Temperance Brennan (played by Emily Deschanel) argues with Seeley Booth (played by David Boreanaz) about whether or not Jesus was a zombie because he came back to life after three days. I loved that but it was more the kind of quip that David and Emily excelled at than high drama where the actor really engaged with a deep emotion.\n\nI've written more than one set of wedding vows, but the vows for Booth and Brennan in <i>Bones<\/i> are my favorite because they were steeped in years and years of history and both actors thrummed with that energy. Booth's face as he watches Brennan state that she has caught him gazing at her over the years when he thought she wasn't looking, well, you don't actually write that stuff but you get credit for it.\n\nI've written some eulogies too — including Brennan's eulogy for a dog, again watched by Booth as he falls ever more deeply in love with Brennan. David and Emily... <i>whooh<\/i>.\n\nAvowals of Love. Proposals. Last Words — Vincent Nigel Murray (played by Ryan Cartwright, again on <i>Bones<\/i>) as he gasped his last to Booth and Brennan. Then there was a deathbed reconciliation in the last episode of <i>The Finder<\/i> between Walter Sherman (played by Geoff Stults) and his dying father Franklin (played by John Ashton) that simultaneously made me happy to be a writer and annoyed that people die.\n\nThere was another kind of deathbed confession on <i>Joan of Arcadia<\/i> in which Joan's mother, Helen Girardi (played by Mary Steenburgen) read a suicidal mother's suicide note to her adolescent son, Adam Rove (played brilliantly and silently by Christopher Marquette) — and now, thinking back on that scene, I realize that 16-year-old Joan Girardi (played by Amber Tamblyn), watching her mother read the saddest letter in the world to the grieving boy she loves still blows me away. Three wonderful actors in one of my favorite scenes and only one of them is actually speaking.\n\nRants! What writer doesn't love a good rant? We are all jealous of Shakespeare's soliloquies. In <i>Judging Amy<\/i> I wrote a speech in which social worker Maxine Gray (played by the remarkable Tyne Daly) was driven to explain in a mandatory anger management group exactly why she was so angry and, well, that soliloquy was amazing for me as the writer because it was like seeing a volcano come close to erupting and then decide not to which was somehow more satisfying than actually watching the volcano erupt. Tyne Daly, man. <i>Whooh<\/i>.\n\nBut since you're asking me right now, perhaps due to fresh emotions swirling around the demise of my series <i>Backstrom<\/i>, I'm going to say my favorite scene was what turned out to be the final scene of the entire series in which Detective Everett Backstrom (played by the sublime and profane Rainn Wilson) stands up in front of an Alcoholics Anonymous group and describes why he has, for the first time, found that his life is actually worth living and so wants to be freed from his many addictions... well, that made the all the difficulties and disappointments of getting a network show up and running and on the air only to fail... it made all that effort worth it.\n\nSo today I'm going to say that's my favorite.",

                     "description": "My favorite thing I've ever written for TV kind of changes based on when you ask me. If you ask me after I've just spent a day with my friends' kids, it'll be Padme interacting with a flustered detective on <i>Clone Wars<\/i>. If you ask me when I've just chatted with some of <i>Warehouse 13<\/i>'s amazing, still-loyal fans, it'll be \"Trials,\" in which Myka returns to her partnership with Pete for good and Claudia cements her friendship with Steve after he comes out to her.\n\nBut lately I find myself citing \"Face My Enemy,\" my first episode of <i>Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D<\/i>. There were two things about writing that episode that especially delighted me.\n\nOne, I happened to draw the assignment at a time when I was jonesing to do a little comedy. I find if I go too long without getting to write jokes, or at least what I consider jokes, I start getting antsy. (This is probably related in some way to my nervous habit of undercutting every legitimate emotional situation I face in real life by making wisecracks. It's hard to believe I'm still single!) But I never imagined <i>MAOS<\/i> would be the place I could scratch the comedy itch. And yet I showed up and my first episode was about May and Coulson going undercover at a charity event as a bickering high-society couple. And they were going to dance. I was maybe as happy as I'd been in years.\n\nThe lightheartedness of the undercover situation, of May flirting with their host, of Coulson enjoying the ruse so much, of the ballroom dancing itself (for which Ming and Clark rehearsed tirelessly) — it all gave me license to write with exactly the sense of fun I enjoy so much. It was, for me, pure joy. But it also spoke to a deeper truth about these two characters: the fun was in stark contrast to the continuing dilemma they were facing together. Coulson might be going crazy, and May might have to kill him. And that was the second thing I loved about writing this episode. All that fun was a reminder of the bond shared by these two characters, and it helped set up what I thought was the biggest reveal in the episode — that May cared for her friend so much, she would rather give up everything and whisk him off the grid than take him out as he'd asked. (So, unlike real life, I guess this time I got to undercut the wisecracking with legitimate emotion. Huh.)\n\nI remember thinking at the time that that's what made me so happy to be working on this show: The world set up by Jeff Bell, Maurissa Tancharoen and Jed Whedon, the world I had just stepped into, was so well-defined, so confident, that there was room for me to come in and tell a story that included ballroom dance, May pummeling her own double in an epic fight, a discussion about nostalgia, a go-bag filled with Australian money and two old friends contemplating whether true friendship means being willing to shoot your buddy in the head. All in one episode! I could not have loved it more.",

Now he's treating a young man, 17, who has end-stage cystic fibrosis who wants to be allowed to die with dignity. This goes against everything Clooney's character, Doug Ross, believes in. All kids must be saved, or at least that's what he's always believed, and he's the hero to do it. \n\nLaura Innes' character challenges him: Is saving this kid's life about what he wants or what the kid wants? That's a pivotal moment in the series for Clooney's character and he resolves to let the young man die with dignity. Unfortunately, while the young man is taking his last breath, his mother intervenes and forces Clooney to intubate her son — she has that right because the young man is still a minor. \n\nClooney is furious at the mother for forcing him to resuscitate the young man against his wishes. It's a monumental moment of maturity for the character and I had a blast writing it. I always love personalizing ethical issues through characters' struggles, and <i>ER<\/i>, <i>SVU<\/i>, and now <i>Under the Dome<\/i> allow me to do that. And the topper for this episode was when the kid, now connected to a breathing tube, sees Clooney and flips him off. I negotiated with NBC for a long time to let me have the kid make that \"obscene\" gesture. I wonder if we could do that now…",

                     "description": "The favorite thing I ever wrote for TV is tough question to answer for a few reasons. Comedy is such a collaborative effort — the name you see on the script for a half hour comedy is very, very rarely 100% the words of that one person. It takes a team of writers and actors to make something work — or in some cases not work! That said I can claim ownership over a a lot things — stories, scenes, jokes, ideas, moments — that I think are pretty swell. So here are two I love lot.\n\nI'd been trying to do a version of <i>Gambit<\/i> on <i>Cougar Town<\/i> for years. <i>Gambit<\/i> is a great old flick staring Michael Caine and Shirley McClaine, if you haven't seen it rent it (or buy it — it's worth owning) and read nothing about it before you watch. There's a narrative trick that's just so badass, I knew we could copy it and make a pretty sweet, one-story show. So in Season 3 of <i>Cougar Town<\/i> we did it, and \"A One Story Town\" is probably the episode of that show I'm most proud of. The entire thing is one long sequence of setups and payoffs, and everyone gets something fun to do, and we were able to sneak a little emotion in amid all the fun. All the actors are so great — Courteney Cox and Brian Van Holt especially — and committed to the fun. It was an impossible script in a lot of ways because it was so different than most of the episodes we did. A ton of scenes, some super super short, the pace was nuts, but Bill directed it so well and it just worked. That episode was a favorite because it really showed me you could go after that weird idea, figure it out, and end up with something that's way way better than you could've dreamed of. \n\nThe other thing I'm most proud of is the final scene in the last episode of <i>Enlisted<\/i>. That show was real personal, and I didn't make any secrets about bringing some of the heavy stuff from my own life into it. ( I wrote about them in <i>The Hollywood Reporter<\/i> <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/enlisted-creator-opens-up-life-688125\">here<\/a>.) That last scene of Pete and his brothers and then the rest of his platoon and Keith David on the beach was damn near cathartic. It sums up a lot of how I felt, how I felt Pete's character felt, and brought him and those around him to a place of actual hope (which is just regular hope with the acknowledgement that things still suck and that healing will take time). It also served as a pretty good end to the series! And while it was real personal, it was also funny! And I did get that creator's dream of writing the show off into the sunset. Of course there was collaboration (Mike Royce had the idea that Randy ran into the water, and I was like, great! And the rest can jump in, too!). And hell, the show go to go out on a big hopeful joy bomb and Lori Laughlin is in it and Mel Rodriguez runs to her and M83 was cool enough to let us use the song and Keith David says something I believe to my core: \"It's OK to feel guilt. It's OK to feel joy, too.\" That's something I certainly needed to hear. And now it exists out there in the world and everyone else gets to hear it forever. If they want, you know... <i>Enlisted<\/i> DVDs are available at Amazon right now.",

That&#39;s very important.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>Two weeks ago, Scott Patterson, who played Luke Danes on The WB&#39;s hit series, gave fans <a href=\"http://\">some false hope<\/a>, saying there were talks going on about a <i>Gilmore Girls<\/i> movie. \"I can&#39;t really go into any details, but there is some activity,\" he said <a href=\"http://time.com/3893844/gilmore-girls-reunion/\">during the <i>Gilmore Guys<\/i> podcast<\/a>. \"I&#39;m hopeful, and I&#39;m in. I think it would be a big event, and I think it would be a great fan celebration.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>But at the <i>Gilmore Girls<\/i> reunion panel on Saturday night, Patterson had to eat his words. \"It springs more from hopefulness,\" he said of his \"stock answer\" to the question he gets asked most often. \"It&#39;s like a love letter back to the fans because you guys made this show... I think it&#39;s kinda time, don&#39;t you?\"<\/p>\n\n<p>Sadly though, not quite yet. \"It would have to be the right everything &mdash; the right format, the right timing, the right way,\" Sherman-Palladino said. \"It would have to be honored in a certain way and I think that if you look around, we would all jump in and do it,\" she added, getting nods from the cast.<\/p>\n\n<p>Clearly, she&#39;s thinking about it. Sherman-Palladino has long said she knew what four word would end the series, but unfortunately, she didn&#39;t work on <i>Gilmore Girls<\/i>&#39; final seventh season, so we never got to hear those words. <\/p>\n\n<p>And she wasn&#39;t willing to spill them at the reunion panel either. \"I&#39;m holding onto it still &#39;cause in my mind, I don&#39;t know, who knows...\" she said, trailing off.<\/p>\n\n<p>The only person who knows the four words are her husband, <i>Gilmore Girls<\/i> executive producer/writer Dan Palladino. Even the Gilmore women themselves &mdash; Alexis Bledel (Rory) and Lauren Graham (Lorelai) &mdash; don&#39;t know them. But Graham hopes some day, she will.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"Unless either I am saying them or I&#39;m listening to someone saying them who&#39;s in the show, the way it was intended&hellip;\" she said before applause drowned out her sentence.<\/p>\n\n<p>Eventually, Sherman-Palladino put the topic to rest, telling fans, \"If it ever happened, I promise you we&#39;d do it correctly.\"<\/p>\n\n\n <p><small><\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   <p><strong>LINK:<\/strong> <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/jaimieetkin/gilmore-girls-cast-on-where-their-characters-would-be-now#.ogR22eQlD\" rel=\"nofollow\">Where The “Gilmore Girls” Characters Would Be Now, According To The Cast<\/a><\/p>\n\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small><\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   <p><strong>LINK:<\/strong> <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/jarettwieselman/ed-herrmann-tribute-gilmore-girls-reunion#.mbk99eWon\" rel=\"nofollow\">There Was A Touching Tribute To Ed Herrmann During The “Gilmore Girls” Reunion<\/a><\/p>\n\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small><\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<hr /><p><a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/jaimieetkin/sadly-theres-no-gilmore-girls-movie-in-the-works\">View Entire List &rsaquo;<\/a><\/p>",

That's how fucked up it is that he's gone and I just miss him and I'm so grateful I got to work with him and I got to hear him say my words and I got to see him yell at me [about] dailies because I was making him do too many takes and complain about the dailies because he knows I would sit in the editing room and he would say, 'We're not puppets! We're not puppets!' And he was not a puppet. He was just driven [and] loving; he was our Mr. President.\"",

THERE ARE A LOT OF SHIRTLESS DUDES AT THIS SCREENING PARTY. <i>Entourage<\/i> is the most iconic gay show of our time.\n29. Billy Walsh is still doing drugs, but also he's hot AF too. I'm getting kinda turned on from this movie and I might make out with the bro next to me.\n30. Everyone keeps wondering exactly how much money Turtle made off his deal with Mark Cuban. This is a joke that goes nowhere, BTW, so I won't mention it again whenever it pops up.\n31. It's horribly criminal that Debi Mazar DA GAWD never got a spin-off.\n32. How has Ari not met Lloyd's fiancé yet?\n33. More shirtless guys. This is basically a Bryan Singer party except everyone is above the legal drinking age.\n34. I'm only assuming E is getting all this action because cargo shorts turn women on in this universe.\n35. Vince makes Pharrell perform for the crowd. PHARRELL YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO WHAT THIS WHITE BOY TELLS YOU TO DO.\n36. Also, who would've performed if he wasn't there?!\n37. With all these cameos, I kind want someone random like Gina Gershon to show up.\n38. Haley Joel Osment looks gross and sweaty and like a meninist when he hits on the girl that's clearly into Vince. This won't end well! (Except it will in the end because this is <i>Entourage<\/i>, after all.)\n39. Vince's movie seems the be the exact same as Zac Efron's <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZzAeYWXFpk\">upcoming DJ movie<\/a>. Also Calvin Harris is in it. Plus zombies?\n40. Kid Cudi is playing Ari's assistant, which is a missed opportunity to have this be in the same universe as <i>How to Make it in America<\/i>, but also I'm probably the only person who watched that show.\n41. This cannot be a good movie?! There's a DJ fighting zombies and it looks like a <i>Spring Breakers<\/i> spoof.\n42. Haley Joel Osment is overweight and southern, so of course he has to be the villain and hate the movie.\n43. How to pick up people in lamaze class will be a new self-help book from Chad Lowe.\n44. Kelsey Grammer also shows up as Ari goes to a therapy session because the cameos in this movie are OUT OF CONTROL.\n45. This girl Drama is seeing has a boyfriend who threatens to kill him. Drama always gets really, really lame stories.\n46. E also gets a lame, sexist story where the two girls he fucked try and make him think he got one of them pregnant and got herpes from the other. Fun!\n47. I'm mostly mesmerized by the fact that they're having lunch at The Little Door, one of my favorite restaurants in Los Angles. I even had a birthday dinner there! \n48. Come to think of it, I passed by while they were filming this scene last summer and was annoyed that my route was diverted, but I guess it all worked out in the end! For someone.\n49. Jessica Alba utters the phrase \"#JessicaAlbasAss\" which is still classier than her wig in the <i>Fantastic Four<\/i> movies.\n50. Turtle keeps urging Drama to drink his tequila, which is weird, because he's drinking from a flask so no one can tell what he's drinking.\n51. Everyone is SHOCKED that the movie is being torpedoed because Haley Joel Osment likes the girl that Vince is fucking. I feel like Vince's libido is the cause of every single problem that has ever existed on this series.",

Turtle has to fight Ronda in the ring to win her love, because har har women beating up dudes is funny.\n54. Though come to think of it, it's actually just really hot seeing Turtle in the ring getting all sweaty, and... sorry, where did my mind go?\n55. Chad Lowe is at Drama's audition for <i>Criminal Minds<\/i>. Did he get fired from <i>Pretty Little Liars<\/i> in this universe or...\n56. The son from <i>Married... with Children<\/i> shows up, which I suppose fulfills my wish of a really random AF cameo!\n57. Who filmed Drama's sex tape? I don't think anyone wants to know.\n58. But his masturbation scene is not as funny as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LB9tVIFdu6s\">this scene<\/a> from <i>Broad City<\/i>.\n59. Ari reveals why Haley Joel hates the movie in a dramatic, <i>Dynasty<\/i>-style boardroom confrontation that doesn't end in a Moldavian Massacre-style cliffhanger so what's the point?\n60. Ari fired anyway because he didn't treat Haley with \"respect\" even if he's a horrible person. The moral of this movie is always be nice to assholes with money! Which I guess was the moral of the series from the beginning.\n61. This is supposed to be a very dramatic moment, and probably main point of the film, but I have no doubt that Ari will bounce back from this so whatever!\n62. E and Sloan name their baby Ryan Murphy because they're evil, horrible, no-good people.\n63. Ari asked for equity in Vince's movie and SURPRISE it's a box office smash! I hate these people. But much like another famous gay piece of cinema, I can't quit them. I'd gladly turn over my cash to watch <i>Entourage 2<\/i>.\n64. Jeremy Piven might kinda be looking hot in this movie too, severe spray tan and all.\n65. Vince's movie is nominated for a shitload Golden Globes because even <i>Entourage<\/i> knows that shit ain't winning any Oscars.\n66. Footage from this year's Golden Globe ceremony is spliced in, FORCING GEORGE AND AMAL CLOONEY INTO CAMEOS.\n67. Does Amal Clooney even know what <i>Entourage<\/i> is?!",

Now, after writing two more <i>Saw<\/i> movies and two films of a second franchise, <i>Insidious<\/i>, Whannell is making his directorial debut with <em>Insidious: Chapter 3<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"Filmmaking seems to me to be a lot like skydiving. You can watch a bunch of videos about skydiving. You can learn the theory of it. But you don&#39;t really know what it&#39;s like until you jump out of that plane,\" Whannell told BuzzFeed News at L.A.&#39;s iconic Chateau Marmont, where he wrote most of the third <em>Insidious<\/em> film. \"I don&#39;t know that I was ready at all.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s a big change for Whannell: <em>Insidious: Chapter 3<\/em> not only marks his first time as a director, but also his separation from Wan, whom he met in film school in their native Australia. They embarked on a joint career that yielded <em>Saw<\/em> (Wan directed <em>Saw<\/em> and co-wrote the story of <em>Saw<\/em> and <em>Saw III<\/em> with Whannell, who wrote and starred in the first three) and <em>Insidious<\/em> (written by Whannell, with a story assist from Wan, who directed the first two). Wan has moved on to big-budget studio films, like <em>Furious 7<\/em> and the upcoming <a href=\"http://deadline.com/2015/06/james-wan-aquaman-jason-momoa-dc-comics-warner-bros-1201437282/\"><em>Aquaman<\/em><\/a>. And although he was a producer on <em>Insidious 3<\/em>, Wan was \"pretty hands-off,\" which had its advantages and disadvantages for first-time director Whannell.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"My identity was so wrapped up in being one-half of the Wan-Whannell duo, and I realized I didn&#39;t know who I was without James,\" Whannell said. \"He was doing <em>Furious 7<\/em> at the time, which was kind of a hurricane of a production, with all this tumultuous activity that happened and <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/adambvary/furious-7-ending-paul-walker#.jyjee3JvE\">the tragedy with Paul Walker<\/a>, which stopped production. So he was right in the eye of that storm, and I think he really helped by what he didn&#39;t do. He didn&#39;t lean over my shoulder and tell me to do this, that. He didn&#39;t give me notes or tell me to change things.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>At the same time, Whannell acknowledged that working without Wan at his side was at times a difficult change. \"Things like that always turn out to be the events in your life that kind of shove you forward,\" he said. \"It&#39;s like when you first move out of home and you have your own apartment, and you&#39;re thinking, <em>Oh my god, this is so difficult.<\/em> And then you learn the ropes and you sort of get shoved up the evolutionary ladder a little bit.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"It&#39;s been an ever-evolving journey. This is my first time, and I&#39;m gonna have to learn by making mistakes.\"<\/p>\n\n\n <p><small><\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-06/6/13/enhanced/webdr01/enhanced-14530-1433610728-2.jpg\" width=\"625\" height=\"417\" alt=\"\" /><\/p>\n \n\t<p>Elise (Lin Shaye) steps into the Further in <em>Insidious: Chapter 3<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n <p><small>Focus Features<\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n <p>Whannell&#39;s interest in horror began at a young age: While his friends were extolling the virtues of <em>Star Wars<\/em> and <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark<\/em>, he was haunted by <em>Jaws<\/em>. And that particular genre had its practical advantages for Whannell when he and Wan were looking to make their first feature after film school. Once the duo realized that no one was particularly interested in blindly funding their work, they sought out to create something on their own.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"We started trying to calculate how much money you could make a film for at the absolute base level,\" Whannell said. \"Horror is probably the only genre where a bigger budget doesn&#39;t really help. &#39;Cause what are you gonna do with that extra money? Are you gonna create a special effects sequence where a city gets knocked down, like something out of <em>Man of Steel<\/em>? &hellip; It&#39;s a very friendly genre to first-time filmmakers.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>But even working within horror, Whannell and Wan had to look for ways to cut costs. Their first movie had to be very contained &mdash; the film equivalent of television&#39;s \"bottle episodes\" that lower the budget by taking place all in one room. It was in those early brainstorming sessions that they stumbled on the idea for <em>Saw<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n<p>While the sequels to the 2004 film upped the ante on gore and world expansion, <em>Saw<\/em> itself is a small movie &mdash; the story of two men, Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) and Adam Stanheight (Whannell), who find themselves chained up in a basement with instructions that one must kill the other in order to escape.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"Essentially, <em>Saw<\/em> is the result of us pushing ourselves to come up with this movie,\" Whannell said. \"I always loved the story. There was something about that story for <em>Saw<\/em>, as I was writing it, that gave me confidence &mdash; not so much confidence that it would be a hit movie, but confidence that people would like it.\" <\/p>\n\n<p>And they did. <em>Saw<\/em> turned out to be a massive success, grossing more than $100 million worldwide, birthing a franchise, and becoming a part of the pop culture lexicon. Given the low expectations Whannell and Wan had, <em>Saw<\/em>&#39;s staggering popularity was a thrilling surprise.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"I knew that people would respond to it &mdash; I just didn&#39;t think it would happen on that level,\" Whannell admitted. \"I&#39;m still, to this day, pretty chuffed, pretty happy, that we made a film that impacted popular culture, to the point where journalists had to think up a term to describe the movie.\"<\/p>\n\n\n <p><small><\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<hr /><p><a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/louispeitzman/half-of-the-team-that-changed-horror-is-now-flying-solo\">View Entire List &rsaquo;<\/a><\/p>",

                     "description": "More than a decade ago, <i>Saw<\/i>, directed by James Wan and written by and starring Leigh Whannell, became one of the most profitable horror movies of all time. Now, after writing two more <i>Saw<\/i> movies and two films of a second franchise, <i>Insidious<\/i>, Whannell is making his directorial debut with <em>Insidious: Chapter 3<\/em>.\n\n\"Filmmaking seems to me to be a lot like skydiving. You can watch a bunch of videos about skydiving. You can learn the theory of it. But you don't really know what it's like until you jump out of that plane,\" Whannell told BuzzFeed News at L.A.'s iconic Chateau Marmont, where he wrote most of the third <em>Insidious<\/em> film. \"I don't know that I was ready at all.\"\n\nIt's a big change for Whannell: <em>Insidious: Chapter 3<\/em> not only marks his first time as a director, but also his separation from Wan, whom he met in film school in their native Australia. They embarked on a joint career that yielded <em>Saw<\/em> (Wan directed <em>Saw<\/em> and co-wrote the story of <em>Saw<\/em> and <em>Saw III<\/em> with Whannell, who wrote and starred in the first three) and <em>Insidious<\/em> (written by Whannell, with a story assist from Wan, who directed the first two). Wan has moved on to big-budget studio films, like <em>Furious 7<\/em> and the upcoming <a href=\"http://deadline.com/2015/06/james-wan-aquaman-jason-momoa-dc-comics-warner-bros-1201437282/\"><em>Aquaman<\/em><\/a>. And although he was a producer on <em>Insidious 3<\/em>, Wan was \"pretty hands-off,\" which had its advantages and disadvantages for first-time director Whannell.\n\n\"My identity was so wrapped up in being one-half of the Wan-Whannell duo, and I realized I didn't know who I was without James,\" Whannell said. \"He was doing <em>Furious 7<\/em> at the time, which was kind of a hurricane of a production, with all this tumultuous activity that happened and <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/adambvary/furious-7-ending-paul-walker#.jyjee3JvE\">the tragedy with Paul Walker<\/a>, which stopped production. So he was right in the eye of that storm, and I think he really helped by what he didn't do. He didn't lean over my shoulder and tell me to do this, that. He didn't give me notes or tell me to change things.\"\n\nAt the same time, Whannell acknowledged that working without Wan at his side was at times a difficult change. \"Things like that always turn out to be the events in your life that kind of shove you forward,\" he said. \"It's like when you first move out of home and you have your own apartment, and you're thinking, <em>Oh my god, this is so difficult.<\/em> And then you learn the ropes and you sort of get shoved up the evolutionary ladder a little bit.\n\n\"It's been an ever-evolving journey. This is my first time, and I'm gonna have to learn by making mistakes.\"",

                     "description": "Whannell's interest in horror began at a young age: While his friends were extolling the virtues of <em>Star Wars<\/em> and <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark<\/em>, he was haunted by <em>Jaws<\/em>. And that particular genre had its practical advantages for Whannell when he and Wan were looking to make their first feature after film school. Once the duo realized that no one was particularly interested in blindly funding their work, they sought out to create something on their own.\n\n\"We started trying to calculate how much money you could make a film for at the absolute base level,\" Whannell said. \"Horror is probably the only genre where a bigger budget doesn't really help. 'Cause what are you gonna do with that extra money? Are you gonna create a special effects sequence where a city gets knocked down, like something out of <em>Man of Steel<\/em>? … It's a very friendly genre to first-time filmmakers.\"\n\nBut even working within horror, Whannell and Wan had to look for ways to cut costs. Their first movie had to be very contained — the film equivalent of television's \"bottle episodes\" that lower the budget by taking place all in one room. It was in those early brainstorming sessions that they stumbled on the idea for <em>Saw<\/em>.\n\nWhile the sequels to the 2004 film upped the ante on gore and world expansion, <em>Saw<\/em> itself is a small movie — the story of two men, Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) and Adam Stanheight (Whannell), who find themselves chained up in a basement with instructions that one must kill the other in order to escape.\n\n\"Essentially, <em>Saw<\/em> is the result of us pushing ourselves to come up with this movie,\" Whannell said. \"I always loved the story. There was something about that story for <em>Saw<\/em>, as I was writing it, that gave me confidence — not so much confidence that it would be a hit movie, but confidence that people would like it.\" \n\nAnd they did. <em>Saw<\/em> turned out to be a massive success, grossing more than $100 million worldwide, birthing a franchise, and becoming a part of the pop culture lexicon. Given the low expectations Whannell and Wan had, <em>Saw<\/em>'s staggering popularity was a thrilling surprise.\n\n\"I knew that people would respond to it — I just didn't think it would happen on that level,\" Whannell admitted. \"I'm still, to this day, pretty chuffed, pretty happy, that we made a film that impacted popular culture, to the point where journalists had to think up a term to describe the movie.\"",

                     "description": "The term they came up with was \"torture porn,\" a controversial designation that Whannell has softened on over the years. While he was initially resistant to that characterization, Whannell acknowledges that the franchise came to embrace the title over the years.\n\n\"I'm the first to admit that the sequels to <em>Saw<\/em> got progressively more gory. It's almost like the film retroactively earned that label that it had been given,\" he said. \"You know, like somebody pointing at you, saying, 'Your shirt's dirty,' and you're like, 'You want to see dirty? I'll give you dirty.' And you go and roll in the mud.\"\n\nBecause of the increased focus on bloodshed, Whannell found writing the <em>Saw<\/em> sequels to be a challenge. He wanted to focus on the story and the characters — and the first three <em>Saw<\/em> films do offer developed arcs and intricate backstories — but he was under constant pressure to ramp up the brutality.\n\n\"The producers would be in my ear saying, 'More traps, more blood,'\" Whannell said. \"Because they thought that's what the audience wanted, and it sounds like they were right. I tried as much as I could to at least have a strong story, and maybe that's the reason I couldn't write any more <em>Saw<\/em> movies.\" \n\nHe departed the series as a writer after <em>Saw III<\/em>, but remained an executive producer (along with Wan) through the seventh installment. \"I don't know that I could have come up with any more great stories,\" he said. \"I basically would have been coming up with five or six gory death scenes and then trying to link them somehow. I guess I didn't feel like I had any more to offer.\"\n\nBefore he stopped writing <em>Saw<\/em> sequels, however, Whannell was able to inject Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), the serial killer at the center of the series, with one of his most defining characteristics: terminal brain cancer. The idea came from Whannell's own health problems during the production of the first <em>Saw<\/em> movie.\n\n\"I was having basically anxiety attacks but they were manifesting themselves with headaches and heart palpitations and all this scary stuff, especially since I was in my mid-twenties when you just take health for granted,\" Whannell recalled. \"And it really scared the hell out of me, and I ended up incorporating that into the [<em>Saw II<\/em>] script.\"\n\nGiving Jigsaw — or his alter ego, John Kramer — health problems was part of Whannell's attempt to develop his characters past types, and to add substance to a film that might otherwise be all about its violent set pieces. Illness and recovery have since become something of a recurring trope in Whannell's work, even outside of the <em>Saw<\/em> films.\n\n\"It's just something that's buried in my subconscious that keeps kind of punching its way through to the surface of these scripts,\" Whannell said. \"It's not something that I realized at the time, but now when I look back, almost every film I've written has involved some sort of injury or illness, so I think it's one of those things that keeps recurring thematically even without me pushing it. I'm terrified.\"\n\n<em>Insidious: Chapter 3<\/em>, which incorporates a nasty car accident and a demon with respiratory trouble, is no exception.",

                     "description": "The <em>Insidious<\/em> franchise began in 2011 and was a much-needed second hit for Whannell and Wan, who'd just come off a couple of disappointments in 2007: <em>Dead Silence<\/em>, which Whannell wrote and Wan directed, and <em>Death Sentence<\/em>, directed by Wan, with Whannell taking on an acting role.\n\n\"We had come out with <em>Saw<\/em>, and we had done our little victory lap of Hollywood where everybody wants to high-five you because you've done well, and then we had a couple of years in the wilderness,\" Whannell said.\n\nThen came <em>Insidious<\/em>, for which the duo teamed up with <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/louispeitzman/unfriended-jason-blum-blumhouse-interview#.fs9LLn017\">Jason Blum's Blumhouse Productions<\/a>, notable for producing low-budget horror that often goes on to find mainstream success. <em>Insidious<\/em>, which was made for a paltry $1.5 million and earned nearly $100 million, was a perfect fit.\n\n\"The model [Blum] was offering us was very similar to what we did with <em>Saw<\/em>,\" Whannell said. \"With <em>Saw<\/em>, we had no budget, we weren't paid anything, really short schedule, brutal schedule, but total creative freedom to just make what we wanted. And having gone through the Hollywood mill a couple of times, you realize just how valuable that is.\"\n\nThe germ of the idea for <i>Insidious<\/i> — which follows the Lambert family, headed by Josh (Patrick Wilson) and Renai (Rose Byrne) — originated from the same brainstorming sessions that led Whannell and Wan to conceive <em>Saw<\/em>. Years later when they decided to revisit it, the pair sat down and discussed the modern horror conventions they were sick of. \n\n\"The false scare, I felt like that had become a real trope of modern horror films — the friend banging on the window and the heroine turns around and gets a fright, and it turns out it's just the friend,\" Whannell said. \"If someone's gonna bang on the window, let it be Satan, not the best friend. I think that that was part of the reason that people found it so scary. We just decided to do little things, not exactly rebellious, but just little things that we knew weren't being done.\"\n\nOther innovations included making sure the audience always felt on edge by having the Lambert family attacked during the daytime. (\"We wanted a feeling in the film that you were never safe,\" Whannell said.) He also crafted a more unusual third act in which the film ventures to the Further, an otherworldly place designed with David Lynch in mind.\n\n\"We talked about taking those aspects of a Lynchian film that scare us and putting them in a more commercial context,\" Whannell said. \"Maybe that's the reason people found it so scary, because it was just a little bit off-kilter.\"\n\n<i>Insidious<\/i> also proved to be a hit with many critics, earning more adulation than <em>Saw<\/em> had. Whannell considers it to be his and Wan's \"mini-comeback,\" re-establishing the writer-director team as big names in modern horror, with a distinctive sensibility that separated them from their contemporaries.\n\n\"The first <em>Insidious<\/em> film felt like us kind of restaking our territory,\" Whannell said. \"Like, OK, we're back doing what we did before. We tried the Hollywood shirt on, didn't quite fit, so now we're going back to this model.\"",

Another sequel seemed likely.\n\nBut when Whannell sat down to write <em>Insidious: Chapter 3<\/em>, he ran into a problem. The Lambert family, who had returned as the focal point of the first sequel, had suffered too much. The only other major character Whannell felt could carry the next installment was psychic Elise (Lin Shaye), and she had been killed off at the end of the first <em>Insidious<\/em> and returned as a ghost for the second. Then he found a solution: make the third movie a prequel. \n\nIn <em>Insidious: Chapter 3<\/em>, Elise is a shell of the woman fans remember from the first two films. Plagued by her own (quite literal) demons, she reluctantly helps Quinn (<a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/jarettwieselman/stefanie-scott-gets-to-be-authentic-in-insidious-3-jem\">Stefanie Scott<\/a>), a teenage girl who invites in an evil spirit while attempting to contact her dead mother.\n\n\"[Lin] was really the driving force to go back in time. And I actually love how it turned out,\" Whannell said. \"I loved the blank slate that going back in time gave me, because I could put her in a completely different mind-set and a different set of circumstances and not have to worry about story continuity. It's just a different time.\"\n\nIn another twist on the genre from Whannell, Shaye, who is 71, goes against traditional wisdom of what a horror heroine should look like. With her role in the <em>Insidious<\/em> films, she's emerged as a septuagenarian scream queen.\n\n\"I actually think it's pretty cool that someone Lin's age, someone who doesn't usually get offered lead roles in movies, gets to be the badass,\" Whannell said. \"She's the Rambo of the film, rescuing everyone else as opposed to her being rescued.\"\n\nAs it turned out, Whannell didn't need rescuing either. Without Wan at the helm, <em>Insidious: Chapter 3<\/em> does have a slightly different feel from its predecessors, but despite whatever reservations Whannell had about his own readiness, he has emerged from the experience as a confident filmmaker.\n\n\"In hindsight I couldn't have picked a better first film to direct, because of all of that prior knowledge,\" Whannell said. \"I knew that I wouldn't know how a set goes, but at least I would have that — no one knows these characters better than I do.\"\n\nAs for whether or not he succeeded in his mission to create a worthy successor to the <i>Insidious<\/i> films before it, Whannell concedes that such things are up to audiences to decide. His goals, however, were clear: to make it scary, naturally, and to create the kind of thoughtful, emotionally resonant horror that has distinguished much of his past work.\n\n\"I wanted it to feel like a film that had had a lot of thought put into it,\" Whannell said. \"My worst version of this film would have felt like a quickie, something that was slapped together for the sake of money. Sometimes when you see sequels in franchises, you get that feeling. You get the feeling that the money was right, the people were available, and it all just got put together. I'm hoping that people feel like this is really heartfelt, like whoever made it put their all into it, which I definitely did.\"",

His next film, <em>Cooties<\/em>, a horror comedy he wrote with <em>Glee<\/em>'s Ian Brennan, debuts in September. It's a lot funnier than Whannell's past fare — and that's by design. Because if there's one thing Whannell is certain about when it comes to his career, it's that he wants to keep trying new things.\n\n\"<em>Cooties<\/em> was like a good introductory course because it had one foot in the horror camp and one foot in comedy, but I would absolutely love to just make an all-out comedy for sure. I feel like over the next few years, if I'm lucky enough, I want to make films in a few different genres,\" he revealed. \"People always talk about, 'Hollywood stereotypes you, you can only do this, you can only do that. If you get known for one thing that's the only thing they want you to do.' But I feel like you can drive that perception yourself.\"\n\nBut no matter what genre he tries on next, Whannell will always feel the pull of horror. For all his exploration, he knows that it's a genre that will continue to embrace his originality, and one of the few where risk-taking is consistently rewarded, if not by audiences and critics, then at least by die-hard horror fans.\n\nPerhaps that's why he's not opposed to potentially returning to the <em>Insidious<\/em> franchise — or even <em>Saw<\/em> — should the opportunity arise. The last <i>Saw<\/i> film was dubbed <em>The Final Chapter<\/em>, but those are famous last words in horror. \n\nBut for now, with <em>Insidious: Chapter 3<\/em> behind him, he can move on to thoroughly original work. And if Whannell has his way, he'll be working as a true auteur, writing and directing something entirely of his own devising.\n \n\"This genre in particular needs filmmakers who care, not people who are dismissive about it or view it as something less than,\" he reflected. \"It needs those auteurs.\"",
