There was also an incredibly detailed backstory about how the ghost anchored to the doll was a teenager in the 1950s who lived in Ohio and liked to paint. How did the seller know this? Well, naturally, the ghost of Mary came to the doll's owner in a dream and revealed this information. The listing stated that if you bought the doll, she would come to you in your dreams too. Compared to doors slamming on their own, a dream haunting actually seems quite pleasant. I was sold. (For $33.99.) \n\nDo I really think all the \"haunted\" dolls for sale on eBay are actually haunted? Ehhh, probably not. But would I keep one in my home? Hell no. Instead, I had Mary shipped to my office. \n\nOn the day she arrived, my co-workers looked on with skepticism as I unboxed my new haunted doll. I immediately felt like I had to treat her with respect or risk the wrath of a ghost. \"I feel bad that she's wrapped in bubble wrap,\" I said as I freed her. \"It's a doll!\" replied a co-worker, who would likely regret taking that tone with Mary the <i>haunted<\/i> doll. The doll smelled musty, wore a tasteful plaid dress, and had some weird yellow gunk on her eyes.\n\nMy co-workers were largely not thrilled to have a haunted doll in the office. The negative reaction was stronger than I anticipated. The phrase \"el diablo\" got thrown around a lot. People wanted to burn sage. Our workplace harassment training did not cover paranormal activity, so I wasn't sure if I was creating a hostile work environment or not. Mary was supposed to be a positive spirit! How could anyone be afraid of something wearing such a jaunty velvet hat?",

The app claims to make it possible for paranormal energies to manipulate your phone.

One of the first words the app detected around Mary was the word \"loving.\" (So maybe she IS a positive spirit.) I took Ghost Radar for multiple strolls around the office to see if it detected ghosts in other places, but it rarely detected anything. There was almost no activity on the app unless my phone was around Mary —&nbsp;except for one other corner of the office containing a water cooler and a life-size cardboard cutout of Ryan Gosling, which also seemed particularly haunted according to the app.",

                     "description": "The words the app picks up from the spirit world seem very random, though sometimes disturbing. The first time I felt scared of Mary was when the ghost app detected the word \"incubus\" in her presence. I was also not a fan of the word \"nightmare.\" Another disturbing sequence of words was \"cave,\" \"earthen,\" and \"bones.\" Had Mary been murdered and buried in a cave? It seemed likely.\n\nThe most relevant thing the ghost app picked up from Mary was the word \"Ohio.\" Mary's seller on eBay said the ghost had lived in Ohio when she was alive. Another ghostly coincidence occurred when I skipped a kickboxing class to go to happy hour. I pulled out my ghost app at the bar, and the spirit world said \"exercise\" and \"tonight.\" Apparently ghosts will not miss an opportunity to shame you for your life choices. \n\nPlus an added benefit of having a ghost app on your phone is you can pull it out during awkward silences at a bar when you've run out of things to talk about and just start hunting ghosts until people decide to stop talking to you completely because you're being too weird.\n\nThe eeriest thing the app picked up from Mary were the words \"fear,\" \"astral,\" and \"release.\" Was her spirit trapped inside the doll? Did we need Jennifer Love Hewitt from the canceled CBS show <i>Ghost Whisperer<\/i> to help her spirit cross over and finally be at peace? This was getting intense, and I was starting to grow fond of Mary. Maybe too fond. Some of my co-workers theorized that Mary had possessed me. I found myself saying things like \"I am her keeper and I'll do as I please,\" which was a little disturbing, but not necessarily paranormal.",
