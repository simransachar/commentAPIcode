Well I guess I went too close to one of them one time because it started hissing at me. I remember this random girl standing behind me starting freaking out, saying, <b>\"That's what they do when they're about to charge!!!<\/b>\" So what did I do?\n\n<b>I hissed right back at it. Louder.<\/b>\n\nAnd this goose, which was probably the head honcho of its flock was all, \"Wtf?\" and moved back into the water, signaling for its homies to swim away with it to the other side of the pond.\n\n<b>Final Score<\/b>\nMe: 1\nCanadian Geese: 0\n\nSubmitted by: Caitlin Michelle Beerer (Facebook)",
