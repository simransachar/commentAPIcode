            "description": "<p>Now that Facebook is a publisher, it&#8217;s going to have to grapple with censorship in a big way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\t\n\n\t \n\t\t  <iframe src=\"//instagram.com/p/2jopmANLja/embed/\" height=\"710\" width=\"612\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" ><\/iframe>\n\t  \n\t\n\n\n <p><small><a rel=\"nofollow\"  target=\"_blank\"  href=\"http://instagram.com/p/2jopmANLja/\">instagram.com<\/a><\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n <p>As social platforms replace the web at the center of the digital publishing universe, those platforms will increasingly find themselves making uncomfortable choices: Who is a legitimate publisher? Where to draw the line?<\/p>\n\n<p>And how, to apply the classic speech test to it, about the Nazis?<\/p>\n\n<p>White supremacists, after all, want faster loading times too. The web editor of <a href=\"http://www.amren.com/\">American Renaissance<\/a>, Henry Woolf, told me he would \"consider joining it, certainly,\" after I described Instant Articles to him. <\/p>\n\n<p>A Facebook spokesperson didn&#39;t respond to an inquiry, however, whether a publication like his &mdash; it describes itself as \"race realist\"; the Anti-Defamation League and other groups describe it as white supremacist &mdash; would be welcome on the company&#39;s servers.<\/p>\n\n<p>But classic free speech questions like these &mdash; and related ones about everything from acid to porn &mdash; are becoming increasingly important for companies like Facebook, YouTube, Snapchat, and Twitter. It&#39;s not limited to just social media, either; the most recent entrant to the field is Apple, which announced its own native news app &mdash; Apple News &mdash; at its Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday. (And Apple News will moderate content on its platform.) <\/p>\n\n<p>All of them are wrestling increasingly with the fact that hazy and subjective terms of service &mdash; enforced easily on an individual &mdash; can be deeply polarizing when applied to a popular, or divisive, media outlet or personality. Facebook&#39;s Instagram quickly reversed course after deleting The Shade Room, a kind of TMZ for black celebrities that exists primarily on the platform. And Twitter two weeks ago wrestled with the case of Charles Johnson, a right-wing journalist and provocateur whom it <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2015/05/charles-johnson-banned-from-twitter-207688.html\">banned from the service<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"It would be cool if it were open to everyone,\" Johnson said of Instant Articles in a telephone interview with BuzzFeed News. \"It&#39;s difficult to say; obviously I&#39;ve been censored by Twitter in a capricious and arbitrary way. I think Facebook would do similar kinds of things and censor speech that would not otherwise be censored.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>The difference from controversies past: It&#39;s one thing to cause a publisher trouble on one of its promotional channels; it&#39;s another thing to delete the publication from its main platform.<\/p>\n\n<p>Facebook&#39;s Instant Articles is the year&#39;s most talked-about new platform for publishers, a feature that stores articles on Facebook servers to speed up their loading, while at the moment allowing publishers to serve their own ads. Instant Articles were rolled out first to mainstream publishers &mdash; the <i>New York Times<\/i>, <i>The Atlantic<\/i>, <i>The Guardian<\/i>, <i>National Geographic<\/i>, and BuzzFeed among them &mdash; and are widely expected to be shared with other publishers if the project is well received by users. <\/p>\n\n<p>If it works, fringe figures like Woolf will obviously be drawn to it. Indeed, the fringe has often been early to adapt new communications technologies, starting with the web itself. <\/p>\n\n<p>So will other publishers already struggling with Facebook&#39;s standards, which ban things that are core to much of the web that Facebook is starting to absorb &mdash; women&#39;s nipples, say, and smoking weed.<\/p>\n\n<p>Facebook, needless to say, did not invite the cannabis industry trade publication <a href=\"http://www.dopemagazine.com/\"><i>Dope Magazine<\/i><\/a> to the Instant Articles trial. But they&#39;re already having trouble with the social network.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"I think Facebook needs to review its policies,\" says Jonathan Teeters, director of operations for <i>Dope Magazine<\/i>. <i>Dope<\/i> reports on the cannabis industry, and Teeters feels that it already gets left behind on the social network. \"We trigger security protocols; we can&#39;t boost posts or advertise because we immediately get flagged,\" he said. <\/p>\n\n<p>\"We need better access to the tools that Facebook offers to other publications,\" Teeters said.<\/p>\n\n<p>The alt-porn site <a href=\"https://suicidegirls.com/\">Suicide Girls<\/a> didn&#39;t make the Instant Articles rollout either. <\/p>\n\n<p>And it too has had to navigate an uneven playing field on Facebook, posting links and teasers rather than its own content, said Alexis Crawford, who runs Suicide Girls&#39; social media. <\/p>\n\n<p> \"We are very risqu&eacute;, which means it can be very difficult to navigate,\" she said. (They have done so, incidentally, with great dexterity, running up 6 million Facebook fans.)<\/p>\n\n<p>So, will Instant Articles be open to these ACLU poster children? What version of the First Amendment will extend itself to the dominant new publishing platforms?<\/p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s unclear that Facebook and others have quite thought these things through yet.<\/p>\n\n\n <p><small><\/small><\/p>",

And Twitter two weeks ago wrestled with the case of Charles Johnson, a right-wing journalist and provocateur whom it <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2015/05/charles-johnson-banned-from-twitter-207688.html\">banned from the service<\/a>.\n\n\"It would be cool if it were open to everyone,\" Johnson said of Instant Articles in a telephone interview with BuzzFeed News. \"It's difficult to say; obviously I've been censored by Twitter in a capricious and arbitrary way. I think Facebook would do similar kinds of things and censor speech that would not otherwise be censored.\"\n\nThe difference from controversies past: It's one thing to cause a publisher trouble on one of its promotional channels; it's another thing to delete the publication from its main platform.\n\nFacebook's Instant Articles is the year's most talked-about new platform for publishers, a feature that stores articles on Facebook servers to speed up their loading, while at the moment allowing publishers to serve their own ads. Instant Articles were rolled out first to mainstream publishers ‚Äî the <i>New York Times<\/i>, <i>The Atlantic<\/i>, <i>The Guardian<\/i>, <i>National Geographic<\/i>, and BuzzFeed among them ‚Äî and are widely expected to be shared with other publishers if the project is well received by users. \n\nIf it works, fringe figures like Woolf will obviously be drawn to it. Indeed, the fringe has often been early to adapt new communications technologies, starting with the web itself. \n\nSo will other publishers already struggling with Facebook's standards, which ban things that are core to much of the web that Facebook is starting to absorb ‚Äî women's nipples, say, and smoking weed.\n\nFacebook, needless to say, did not invite the cannabis industry trade publication <a href=\"http://www.dopemagazine.com/\"><i>Dope Magazine<\/i><\/a> to the Instant Articles trial. But they're already having trouble with the social network.\n\n\"I think Facebook needs to review its policies,\" says Jonathan Teeters, director of operations for <i>Dope Magazine<\/i>. <i>Dope<\/i> reports on the cannabis industry, and Teeters feels that it already gets left behind on the social network. \"We trigger security protocols; we can't boost posts or advertise because we immediately get flagged,\" he said. \n\n\"We need better access to the tools that Facebook offers to other publications,\" Teeters said.\n\nThe alt-porn site <a href=\"https://suicidegirls.com/\">Suicide Girls<\/a> didn't make the Instant Articles rollout either. \n\nAnd it too has had to navigate an uneven playing field on Facebook, posting links and teasers rather than its own content, said Alexis Crawford, who runs Suicide Girls' social media. \n\n \"We are very risqu√©, which means it can be very difficult to navigate,\" she said. (They have done so, incidentally, with great dexterity, running up 6 million Facebook fans.)\n\nSo, will Instant Articles be open to these ACLU poster children? What version of the First Amendment will extend itself to the dominant new publishing platforms?\n\nIt's unclear that Facebook and others have quite thought these things through yet.",

Why don't you live in one too?\" boasted of the house's \"collision factor,\" telling applicants that connections it facilitated led to an actual $1 million funding round. An email I sent asking if the ad was a parody was answered with a handful of questions including which company I worked for and my role there. A subsequent email drew a response to the initial question: \"Certainly not a parody.\" The post has since been deleted.\n\nWhile tech house posts like these are worth a chuckle, they're also further anecdotal evidence of the link between tech money and skyrocketing rents in in San Francisco. Real estate website SocketSite recently put the city's <a href=\"http://www.socketsite.com/archives/2015/05/record-high-rents-in-san-francisco-east-bay-rents-accelerating.html\">median rent<\/a> at $3,458 per month -- up 13% over the previous year and 56% since 2009. Tech houses fueled by venture capital money surely can't be helping.",

PAUL J. RICHAR<\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n <p>The Federal Trade Commission hosted a wide-ranging seminar Tuesday to debate issues of public safety and market competition in the emerging on-demand economy, with representatives from some of the field&#39;s major players facing off in panels against critics.<\/p>\n\n<p>During her opening remarks, Commissioner Maureen Ohlhausen assured Uber, Airbnb, and other platforms like them that they shouldn&#39;t view the FTC as an adversary, but as a potential ally. <\/p>\n\n<p>\"We did not convene today&#39;s workshop as a prelude to some planned, big enforcement push in this space,\" she said. <\/p>\n\n<p>But during a day-long discussion with economists, policy experts, and industry stakeholders, concerns about market power, uneven regulation, and data privacy were clearly top of mind. <\/p>\n\n<p>In one panel, Matthew Daus, a former Chairman of the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, faced off against Ashwini Chhabra, Uber&#39;s head of policy development, arguing that the company skirts labor and liability rules.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"I don&#39;t really know what we are sharing,\" Daus said. \"This is about a person getting into a car, going from point A to point B, paying money for it, and a company making a profit.\" <\/p>\n\n<p>Daus believes the term \"sharing economy\" is a misleading descriptor for Uber, which he sees as simply for-hire transportation. He argued that Uber should be more strictly regulated, pointing to the importance of stringent background checks for drivers and access for people with disabilities.<\/p>\n\n<p>In another contentious dialogue, Airbnb&#39;s head of global public policy, David Hantman, tangled with the American Hotel and Lodging Association&#39;s head of government affairs, Vanessa Sinders, who framed her comments on hotels as a request for equal treatment. <\/p>\n\n<p>\"Right now there is an unlevel playing field that is compromising consumer safety and endangering the character and security of residential neighborhoods across the country,\" she said. <\/p>\n\n<p>Referring to the <a href=\"http://www.ag.ny.gov/pdfs/Airbnb%20report.pdf\">New York Attorney General&#39;s report on Airbnb&#39;s operations<\/a> in the city, which found that a small percentage of commercial users dominate the platform, Sinders argued that Airbnb props up illegal hotels, undermining industry standards. <\/p>\n\n<p>Both Uber&#39;s Chhabra and Airbnb&#39;s Hantman emphasized the financial perks of using their respective platforms, and the public benefits they claim to provide to the cities in which they operate.<\/p>\n\n<p>Chhabra painted a picture of a cab industry shielded by artificial regulatory barriers and beset by inertia. Forward-looking governments should remove those barriers, allowing Uber and transportation companies like it to grow, he argued. Chhabra praised Uber for taking drunk drivers off the road, serving neighborhoods with historically poor transit options, and creating a source of income for drivers. <\/p>\n\n<p>Hantman, too, emphasized what he described as the web economy&#39;s ability to do what governments can&#39;t. <\/p>\n\n<p>\"It&#39;s increasingly the case that online reputation systems that reward good behavior and punish bad behavior are serving much of the purposes served by government regulation,\" he said. (<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/11/your-money/questions-about-airbnbs-responsibility-after-vicious-attack-by-dog.html\">An Argentinian rottweiler disagrees<\/a>.) <\/p>\n\n<p>Hantman claimed Airbnb has never been more transparent or safe and that most renters are individuals and families, many of whom rely on Airbnb for essential income. <\/p>\n\n<p>\"People doing something once in a while with their own property to make ends meet is something very different than someone doing it fulltime as a business,\" he said.<\/p>\n\n<p>Only at the end of the panel did the issue of worker classification &mdash; whether on-demand workers should be classified as employees and not independent contractors &mdash; come up. <\/p>\n\n<p>Brooks Rainwater, director of the city solutions and applied research center at the League of Cities, proposed that the federal government step in, perhaps creating a hybrid class of worker with some of the benefits and protections of an employee. Currently, Uber and Lyft drivers are designated as contractors, though some drivers allege they are subject to a high degree of control by their platform-bosses, meriting employment status. Two pending California jury trials may decide the outcome.<\/p>\n\n<p>Absent from the entire sharing economy workshop: Actual sharing economy workers. Arun Sundararajan, a professor at New York University&#39;s Stern School of Business and a participant at the FTC event, proposed another workshop focusing just on important labor issues.<\/p>\n\n<p>The remarks from Rainwater and Sundararajan follow a significant <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/hamzashaban/on-demand-economy-collides-with-presidential-politics-in-war#.bpNq4OkJR1\">policy initiative by Virginia Senator Mark Warner<\/a>, who would like to see worker misclassification resolved by federal legislation. Warner has also pitched an array of safety-net proposals to protect the temporary and freelance workers of the sharing economy. <\/p>\n\n<p>On-demand labor, and the broader disintegration of stable work with a single employer is expected to become a more visible issue in the 2016 campaign.<\/p>\n\n\n <p><small><\/small><\/p>",

The group &mdash; also known as Pawn Storm, Tsar Team, Sednit, and Fancy Bear &mdash; has been hacking into computer networks for the past seven years using highly advanced and aggressive methods, according to an October 2014 <a href=\"https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2014/10/apt28-a-window-into-russias-cyber-espionage-operations.html\">report<\/a> released by FireEye. The report argues that APT28 is sponsored by a government unit based in Moscow. <\/p>\n\n<p>\"Russia has a long history of using information operations to sow disinformation and discord, and to confuse the situation in a way that could benefit them,\" Weedon told BuzzFeed News. \"In this case, it&#39;s possible that the ISIS cyber caliphate could be a distraction. This could be a touch run to see if they could pull off a coordinated attack on a media outlet that resulted in stopping broadcasts, and stopping news dissemination.\" <\/p>\n\n<p>Weedon said that researchers at FireEye had eyes on APT28&#39;s infrastructure and had seen it target other journalists around the same time as the TV5Monde attack. France&#39;s <i>L&#39;Express<\/i> newspaper published <a href=\"http://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/medias/piratage-de-tv5-monde-la-piste-russe_1687673.html\">a story<\/a> Tuesday citing judicial sources who said that investigators had turned their attention away from ISIS and toward a group of Russian hackers. The paper said it would reveal more details on the investigation Wednesday. <\/p>\n\n<p>The April 8 attack on the TV5Monde managed to take down the internationally broadcast television network for a full 18 hours.

The Supreme Court <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/02/us/supreme-court-rules-in-anthony-elonis-online-threats-case.html\">recently ruled<\/a> that \"true threats\" must be made with some knowledge or intent that the threat will be taken seriously.\n\nKimberly Chow, an attorney for the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, said the comments on <i>Reason<\/i> clearly fall within the internet's regular, if outrageous and often vile, discourse.\n\n\"In terms of the comments, everybody knows the internet is a forum where exaggeration and hyperbole take place,\" Chow told BuzzFeed News. \"These comments are in that category. Nobody believes that these people are going to go and put this judge in a wood chipper.\"\n\nFree speech advocates also worry that such subpoenas burden websites with significant legal costs and could have a chilling effect on speech. The subpoena also has specific implications for anonymous speech.\n\nKyu Youm, a professor at the University of Oregon School of Journalism and First Amendment scholar, called the Justice Department subpoena \"a misplacement of priorities\" in an interview with BuzzFeed News.\n\n\"Generally speaking, anonymity is still a part of freedom of expression, and just because the government wants to unmask the commenters does not mean it has a strong case,\" Youm said. \"At least, if there is doubt as to the validity of the subpoena, anonymity should be given the benefit of the doubt.\"\n\n\"The subpoena is not compelling,\" Youm continued.\n\nThe Justice Department and <i>Reason<\/i> both declined requests for comment.",

Maybe your first stop isn&#39;t a music service at all &mdash; to really get current with an artist in 2015, best to check their Twitter account or Instagram.<\/p>\n\n<p>These days, being a music fan can make shopping for health insurance look like a breeze. It&#39;s never been easier for artists to make music and put it out into the world, but it takes an ever-expanding coalition of apps and user accounts to access it all. <\/p>\n\n<p>In the moment during yesterday&#39;s dramatic unveiling of <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/brendanklinkenberg/meet-apples-new-streaming-muisc-and-radio-service-apple-musi#.derZ14mbp\">Apple Music<\/a> that rang the most true, former Interscope Records chair and current Apple executive Jimmy Iovine called this state of affairs \"a fragmented mess.\" Apple brought order to a music industry thrust into disarray once before by creating iTunes and the download economy in 2003; but the dam didn&#39;t hold. Now reclaiming its position at music&#39;s center of gravity is more than a matter of vanquishing competitors like Spotify, or Pandora, or SoundCloud, or Sirius XM. To leap-frog them all, Apple wants to make listening to the full universe of music something that it hasn&#39;t been in a long time &mdash; truly effortless. <\/p>\n\n<p>Apple Music smartly targets three of the most persistent trends in music consumption over the past five years &mdash; on-demand streaming, curated radio, and direct-to-fan distribution &mdash; and unites them into the sort of cohesive, tidy ecosystem for which Apple is known. To quote the company&#39;s two-sentence pitch line, it&#39;s \"All the ways you love music. All in one place.\" The streaming functionality promises instant access to tens of millions of songs and albums, plus a personalized gallery of recommended artists and playlists right next to the full catalog of music you already own on your devices. The radio service, Beats 1, offers a nonstop, set-it-and-forget-it lineup of music and interviews, including sought-after exclusives, overseen by some of the world&#39;s best DJs.

The company has a history of excelling in similar environments to the one that plagues music right now, where the fast, tumultuous rise of new technology has inevitably led to a broken user experience. With the iPod and iTunes, Apple offered consumers who were suddenly inundated with digital music files a way to easily organize and play them on the go. With the iPhone and the App Store, it turned geeky and impenetrable smartphones into a new kind of personal computer that no one wanted to live without.

But there are still formidable obstacles. <\/p>\n\n<p>For one thing, music fans, as Spotify&#39;s growth has shown and Jay Z has recently learned, are notoriously impatient and care about nothing so much as the ability to access what they want, when they want it, at little or preferably no cost. And given that the non-on-demand functions of Apple Music &mdash; Beats 1 and Connect &mdash; are available for free without a membership, they won&#39;t make strong arguments to cancel your streaming service of choice. <\/p>\n\n<p>But streaming music is still in its infancy as a platform &mdash; Netflix still has four times as many paid subscribers as Spotify, the world&#39;s largest subscription music service &mdash; and Apple has no doubt set its sights on the vast majority of the population that has yet to get on board. Apple Music&#39;s 90-day free trial period and ubiquity on hundreds of millions of Apple devices should give it the fighting chance that Beats Music never had &mdash; and it will need all the help it can get. No subscription service has achieved massive scale with its best stuff behind a paywall. (Spotify, whose free tier <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/11487187/Spotify-must-change-its-free-music-service-says-Universal-records.html\">is under increasing pressure<\/a> from the labels, may soon end up stuck behind a paywall of its own.)<\/p>\n\n<p>Additionally, incumbents in the spaces in which Apple is looking to compete, particularly Spotify, SoundCloud, and YouTube, have succeeded in large part because of their ability to play well with the open internet, something Apple has always struggled or refused to do. Spotify playlists, SoundCloud tracks, and YouTube videos share easily on social media and blogs, leveraging the connective power of the web by meeting people where they live. iTunes, meanwhile, didn&#39;t even have webpages for albums until four years ago, and Ping, Apple&#39;s attempt at a Facebook-like social network around music, was dead on arrival for the same reason. <\/p>\n\n<p>The most successful music artists today, including Drake, who spoke onstage at the event yesterday, create unmissable music and visuals that spread virally online. If that can&#39;t happen on Apple Music, both fans and artists will quickly move on. Apple says posts on the Connect feature will be shareable on Facebook and Twitter, which is a good start. But it&#39;s not enough &mdash; they need to also be embeddable, and the same should apply to every song and playlist in the Apple Music catalog.<\/p>\n\n<p>Beats 1 is perhaps the most interesting aspect of Apple Music, and may wind up being the most influential. iTunes Radio failed because it didn&#39;t offer a meaningful improvement on what Pandora had already given tens of millions of faithful listeners, but Beats 1 has an entirely different proposition, i.e., taking what people love about traditional radio &mdash; on-air personalities, interviews, and a communal experience &mdash; and updating it for the mobile era.

The company said the new Intel Capital Diversity Fund isn&#39;t about charity: it&#39;s about making money from opportunities that less diverse startups are failing to go after. <\/p>\n\n<p>It has already invested in four companies, according to today&#39;s announcement, including Brit + Co, the San Francisco-based D.I.Y. site.

The company said the new Intel Capital Diversity Fund isn't about charity: it's about making money from opportunities that less diverse startups are failing to go after. \n\nIt has already invested in four companies, according to today's announcement, including Brit + Co, the San Francisco-based D.I.Y. site. (Brit + Co separately announced the investment today as part of its $20 million Series B financing round.)\n\nLisa M. Lambert, the Intel Capital managing director who is leading the diversity fund, said the point was not to make \"a political or social statement.\" Instead, she said, \"We think it's good business.\"\n\nAny startup dominated by white men, she argued, is at a certain disadvantage if it wants to reach a broad base of customers.\n\n\"The absence of these underrepresented groups in tech says the products we're designing couldn't possibly serve a diverse population, because they're not being conceived by a diverse population,\" Lambert told BuzzFeed News. \"Just imagine the value we could create if we did have that diversity.\"\n\nIntel is currently taking a hard look at the diversity of its own workforce.
