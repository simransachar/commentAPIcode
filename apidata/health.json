It could be about bringing creativity, curiosity, and wisdom into your life. It could be about strengthening your relationship with yourself or the world around you. It could even be about finding some higher guiding path to make existing a little easier. (To be clear, we&#39;re not talking about any particular religious beliefs here &mdash; or even religion in general.) <\/p>\n\n<p>How you personalize it and make it a part of your life is up to you. To give you some ideas for being spiritual no matter your belief system, we talked to these two super-knowledgeable experts in the field: <a href=\"http://www.lisamillerphd.com/\">Lisa Miller<\/a>, Ph.D., founder and executive director of the Spirituality and Mind-Body Institute at Columbia University and author of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OFL6PE0/?tag=buzz0f-20\"><i>The Spiritual Child: The New Science on Parenting for Health and Lifelong Thriving<\/i><\/a>; and spiritual counselor <a href=\"http://vlontarot.com\">Kelsey Avalon<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n <p><small>Jaime Martínez / Via <a rel=\"nofollow\"  target=\"_blank\"  href=\"http://fuckyoudraculas.tumblr.com/post/13178032048\">fuckyoudraculas.tumblr.com<\/a><\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n <p>And obviously, feel free to be skeptical and just do some of this stuff for shits and giggles because... why not?<\/p>\n\n\n <p><small><\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t<h1>Pick someone you admire and let them be your guide.<\/h1>\n\n   <p><img src=\"http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-06/5/12/enhanced/webdr01/enhanced-29316-1433522495-2.png\" width=\"625\" height=\"465\" alt=\"Pick someone you admire and let them be your guide.\" /><\/p>\n \n\t<p>You&#39;ve probably jokingly/drunkenly proclaimed your spirit animal, but Avalon suggests actually putting that into practice when you need guidance. \"Tap into people who have inspired you and use their energy in a healing or guiding way,\" she says.

If you think you can do more than two additional reps with perfect form, you should go up in weight.\n\n• The dumbbell exercises can be done as bodyweight-only exercises if they're too challenging to do as written (or if you don't have access to weights).",

If you think you can do more than two additional reps with perfect form, you should go up in weight.\n\n• The dumbbell exercises can be done as bodyweight-only exercises if they're too challenging to do as written (or if you don't have access to weights).",

If you think you can do more than two additional reps with perfect form, you should go up in weight.\n\n• The dumbbell exercises can be done as bodyweight-only exercises if they're too challenging to do as written (or if you don't have access to weights).",

You know that your mind is awake and your body is not &mdash; so you&#39;re trapped, essentially,\" Michael Breus, Ph.D., clinical psychologist and fellow of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, tells BuzzFeed Life.<\/p>\n\n\n <p><small>ABC / Via <a rel=\"nofollow\"  target=\"_blank\"  href=\"http://lostoceanic815.blogspot.com/2012/10/epic-deaths.html\">lostoceanic815.blogspot.com<\/a><\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t<h1>And it's way more complicated than a nightmare.<\/h1>\n\n   <p><img src=\"http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-04/22/4/enhanced/webdr09/anigif_enhanced-buzz-29404-1429690957-15.gif\" width=\"500\" height=\"290\" alt=\"And it's way more complicated than a nightmare.\" /><\/p>\n \n\t<p>\"It is the complete opposite, actually,\" Breus explains. When you enter deep REM sleep, your brain tells the body&#39;s voluntary muscles to relax and go into almost a state of paralysis, which is called <a href=\"http://www.sleepeducation.com/sleep-disorders-by-category/parasomnias/sleep-paralysis/overview-facts\">atonia<\/a>. Atonia actually helps protect the body from injury by preventing you from acting out the physical movements in your dreams. In other parasomnias, such as sleepwalking or <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rem-sleep-behavior-disorder/basics/definition/con-20036654\">REM sleep behavior disorder<\/a>, atonia does not occur properly and the voluntary muscles move while the mind remains asleep, which is why people can sometimes <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/09/sleepwalking-man-walks-off-cliff_n_5789896.html\">do crazy things<\/a> in their sleep and be totally unaware of it. <\/p>\n\n<p>In sleep paralysis, the body remains paralyzed in REM atonia while the brain awakens and the eyes start to open, explains Breus. Sufferers become alert in a transient conscious state, but they are unable to move voluntary muscles or speak. Although involuntary muscle movement, like breathing, is not affected, there is often a sensation of chest pressure, which is why many people wake up from sleep paralysis gasping to take a deep breath. Episodes can last anywhere from 20 seconds to a few minutes.<\/p>\n\n\n <p><small>FX / Via <a rel=\"nofollow\"  target=\"_blank\"  href=\"http://rollergirlsarebatshitcrazy.tumblr.com/post/33690469744/when-you-get-stuck-sharing-a-bed-with-the-only\">rollergirlsarebatshitcrazy.tumblr.com<\/a><\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t<h1>It happens when you're falling asleep or waking up.<\/h1>\n\n   <p><img src=\"http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-04/22/6/enhanced/webdr07/anigif_enhanced-buzz-11280-1429697681-35.gif\" width=\"500\" height=\"278\" alt=\"It happens when you're falling asleep or waking up.\" /><\/p>\n \n\t<p>Sleep paralysis can occur during one of two transitions in the sleep cycle. The body must go into REM sleep, and it must come out of it, but sleep paralysis occurs when the body has trouble making these transitions. If it happens when you&#39;re falling asleep, it&#39;s called hypnagogic sleep paralysis, whereas if it happens during waking it&#39;s called hypnopompic, Breus explains. Unfortunately, <i>why<\/i> the body can&#39;t transition smoothly is still unknown.<\/p>\n\n\n <p><small><a rel=\"nofollow\"  target=\"_blank\"  href=\"http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/video/adventuretime/\">cartoonnetwork.com<\/a> / Via <a rel=\"nofollow\"  target=\"_blank\"  href=\"http://www.bustle.com/articles/72293-julianna-margulies-says-alicia-finn-wont-hook-up-on-the-good-wife-but-here-are\">bustle.com<\/a><\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<hr /><p><a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/carolinekee/sleep-paralysis-is-scary-af\">View Entire List &rsaquo;<\/a><\/p>",

                     "description": "\"It is the complete opposite, actually,\" Breus explains. When you enter deep REM sleep, your brain tells the body's voluntary muscles to relax and go into almost a state of paralysis, which is called <a href=\"http://www.sleepeducation.com/sleep-disorders-by-category/parasomnias/sleep-paralysis/overview-facts\">atonia<\/a>. Atonia actually helps protect the body from injury by preventing you from acting out the physical movements in your dreams. In other parasomnias, such as sleepwalking or <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rem-sleep-behavior-disorder/basics/definition/con-20036654\">REM sleep behavior disorder<\/a>, atonia does not occur properly and the voluntary muscles move while the mind remains asleep, which is why people can sometimes <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/09/sleepwalking-man-walks-off-cliff_n_5789896.html\">do crazy things<\/a> in their sleep and be totally unaware of it. \n\nIn sleep paralysis, the body remains paralyzed in REM atonia while the brain awakens and the eyes start to open, explains Breus. Sufferers become alert in a transient conscious state, but they are unable to move voluntary muscles or speak. Although involuntary muscle movement, like breathing, is not affected, there is often a sensation of chest pressure, which is why many people wake up from sleep paralysis gasping to take a deep breath. Episodes can last anywhere from 20 seconds to a few minutes.",
