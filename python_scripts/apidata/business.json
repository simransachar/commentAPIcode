We are there to create set and advance that conversation,\" he told BuzzFeed News.<\/p>\n\n<p>Van Winkle&#39;s started when Casper, the <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/iknowkayleen/slumber-party#.kiYEdXgMv\">venture-funded mattress startup<\/a> (it shares some investors with BuzzFeed), started talking last year with <i>Gawker<\/i> and <i>New York Observer<\/i> alumna Elizabeth Spiers, who now works as consultant. \"We wanted to do a content property that would really own sleep,\" Spiers said. <\/p>\n\n<p>\"I&#39;ve worked on content properties before and really good content is the most cost effective form of marketing you can have,\" Spiers said. To ensure the quality of the eventual product, she stressed the need for independence from its backers, which was important \"if you want to have good content people want to read.\" <\/p>\n\n<p>So, they settled on a site set apart from Casper, although it&#39;s funded by the company and works out of its offices. The branding on the site is very light &mdash; at the bottom of the page it says \"published by Casper\" and the site&#39;s about page says \"<a href=\"https://vanwinkles.com/about\">Van Winkle&#39;s is published by Casper Sleep, Inc<\/a>.\" <\/p>\n\n<p>Right now, the site doesn&#39;t have any ads, but the long-term goal is to \"generate revenue through ad support,\" Philip Krim, a co-founder of Casper and the company&#39;s chief executive, told BuzzFeed News. \"We just have to create the best editorial content out there and build a big stand alone site that will resonate with people.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>But one thing you won&#39;t see on Van Winkle&#39;s is writing about mattresses, whether they&#39;re ones made by Casper or its competitors. Koyen said the mattress industry is on a \"black list\" of subjects the site will not write about. \"There are deeper issues, wider issues,\" he said. \"There&#39;s not a lot of journalism to be done about mattresses.\"<\/p>\n\n\n <p><small><\/small><\/p>",

                     "description": "The company trying to disrupt the mattress industry has a new product: a website focused on sleep.\n\n<a href=\"https://vanwinkles.com/\">Van Winkle's<\/a>, which is funded by Casper and lead by editor-in-chief Jeff Koyen and editorial director Elizabeth Spiers, launched Tuesday with a collection of aggregation (<a href=\"https://vanwinkles.com/alan-alda-explores-sleep-at-2015-world-science-festival\">Alan Alda Explores Sleep at the 2015 World Science Festival<\/a>), lists (<a href=\"https://vanwinkles.com/dream-sequence-cliches\">12 Overused Dream Sequence ClichÃ©s<\/a>), short write ups of medical news (<a href=\"https://vanwinkles.com/can-400-pairs-of-twins-help-scientists\">Can 400 Pairs of Twins Help Scientists Prove Fibromyalgia Exists?<\/a>), and a 2,800 word feature on <a href=\"https://vanwinkles.com/bedtime-for-benzodiazepines-addicted-drug-most-popular-sleeping-pills\">the rise of benzodiazepines<\/a> being prescribed for sleep.\n\nThe site has a small staff â€” three editors and a staff writer â€” but is commissioning pieces from freelancers, a process that started two months ago. \n\n\"It's the first editorial venture of its kind, no one has treated sleep as an editorial vehicle like food and nesting,\" explained editor in chief Jeff Koyen, a veteran journalist who has worked at magazines, websites, and startups. \"We're looking at a larger culture, is there a shift of consciousness about sleep? We are there to create set and advance that conversation,\" he told BuzzFeed News.\n\nVan Winkle's started when Casper, the <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/iknowkayleen/slumber-party#.kiYEdXgMv\">venture-funded mattress startup<\/a> (it shares some investors with BuzzFeed), started talking last year with <i>Gawker<\/i> and <i>New York Observer<\/i> alumna Elizabeth Spiers, who now works as consultant. \"We wanted to do a content property that would really own sleep,\" Spiers said. \n\n\"I've worked on content properties before and really good content is the most cost effective form of marketing you can have,\" Spiers said. To ensure the quality of the eventual product, she stressed the need for independence from its backers, which was important \"if you want to have good content people want to read.\" \n\nSo, they settled on a site set apart from Casper, although it's funded by the company and works out of its offices. The branding on the site is very light â€” at the bottom of the page it says \"published by Casper\" and the site's about page says \"<a href=\"https://vanwinkles.com/about\">Van Winkle's is published by Casper Sleep, Inc<\/a>.\" \n\nRight now, the site doesn't have any ads, but the long-term goal is to \"generate revenue through ad support,\" Philip Krim, a co-founder of Casper and the company's chief executive, told BuzzFeed News. \"We just have to create the best editorial content out there and build a big stand alone site that will resonate with people.\"\n\nBut one thing you won't see on Van Winkle's is writing about mattresses, whether they're ones made by Casper or its competitors. Koyen said the mattress industry is on a \"black list\" of subjects the site will not write about. \"There are deeper issues, wider issues,\" he said. \"There's not a lot of journalism to be done about mattresses.\"",

But most of those extra shifts came in the form of \"call-in\" work: days that an employee needs be available, often until hours before start time, with no guarantee of getting any work, or pay.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"I had to call one hour before,\" Hurley, 26, told BuzzFeed News in an interview. \"I was about 25 to 30 minutes away, depending on traffic. They would either put me on hold or I would have to call a store several times before someone would pick up. I would be looking at my watch and starting to sweat because I would be late. They stressed to get there on time.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>Hurley would work 30 hours on a good week. The next, she might clock in 10, even though still she had to be ready to come in within an hour of each call. That made it hard to find other part-time work to smooth out the unpredictable hours, and her income fluctuated wildly, although the payments for her car, student loans, credit cards, cell phone, and groceries stayed just the same.<\/p>\n\n<p>Hurley&#39;s experience with call-in shifts has become a common tale in the retail industry. Chains keep employees on the hook up until the last minute, a move that costs them nothing and helps minimize labor costs. Software helps them understand staffing needs in real time, and evidence suggests a national chain can save tens of millions of dollars a year by keeping workers on call and canceling at the last minute, rather than paying for an hour or two of work by staffers sent home when business is slow.<\/p>\n\n<p>This wreaks havoc on employees&#39; lives. Staff who miss making a call in the window prior to a shift, or who do call but cannot make it to work on time, typically receive the same punishment as someone who skips a regularly scheduled shift. At Urban Outfitters, company policy says on-call shifts \"are considered scheduled shifts, and the same attendance policy applies,\" according to a company handbook shared with BuzzFeed News.<\/p>\n\n<p>Ray Mitchell, 28, who worked at an Urban Outfitters in Atlanta starting in 2013, said on-call scheduling \"held you hostage for what you could do each day.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>One can&#39;t secure other paid work or take classes during a scheduled call-in shift. But if it&#39;s canceled, the employee gets nothing in return, and they may have arranged for child care or elder care that&#39;s ultimately unnecessary. And it&#39;s far harder to budget when pay swings up and down based on a daily phone call. In some scenarios, the uncertainty can prevent people from claiming government benefits like food stamps and housing assistance because they can&#39;t accurately estimate their income.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"You lose an enormous amount of personal autonomy,\" said David Leimbach, a lawyer representing Victoria&#39;s Secret employees suing the company over its labor practices, including on-call scheduling.<\/p>\n\n\n <p><small><\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-06/2/14/enhanced/webdr10/enhanced-1546-1433271251-2.png\" width=\"507\" height=\"753\" alt=\"\" /><\/p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Via <a rel=\"nofollow\"  target=\"_blank\"  href=\"https://twitter.com/ChelseaRosario_/status/591703075322138624/photo/1\">Twitter: @ChelseaRosario_<\/a><\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n <p>The Victoria&#39;s Secret lawsuit, taking place in California, is happening in parallel to a probe into on-call scheduling by the New York State attorney general&#39;s office.

                     "description": "The class-action lawsuit, filed by former Victoria's Secret sales clerk Mayra Casas last July, accuses the bra-and-panty powerhouse of wage theft. Lawyers for Casas, who started working at the chain in mid-2010 and continued to after the lawsuit was filed, say Victoria's Secret regularly schedules workers for mandatory on-call shifts for 15 to 20 hours a week, requiring them to telephone the store two hours ahead of time. \n \nVictoria's Secret employees may be scheduled for more than 30 hours of work across five days in a week, but ultimately work only 10 of those hours, the complaint said. Aside from the logistical hassle of planning life around such an unpredictable schedule, it makes earning a living wage even tougher. At a $9 minimum wage, the difference between 30 scheduled hours and the 10 actually worked turns out to be earning $270 versus $90 in a week, or $1,080 against $360 in a month.\n\nCasas, who is in her twenties, was struggling to accommodate the call-in shifts with hours from another part-time job, a juggle that rendered it nearly impossible to explore higher education, Leimbach said. Some of the policies felt wrong, so she contacted Leimbach's firm, Marlin &amp; Saltzman, to discover if it was illegal. Both Victoria's Secret and Bath &amp; Body Works are owned by parent company L Brands, which posted net profit of $1.04 billion for the year ended Jan. 31, a 15% increase from the previous year. \n\nThe company declined to comment, citing the ongoing litigation. \n\nCalifornia law requires employers to pay workers who \"report for work\" but aren't permitted to work at least half their scheduled shift. Lawyers for Casas argue that same law, though historically applied to people who show up at a work site and are dismissed early, should also be extended to employees making those last-minute phone calls, as they are, essentially, \"reporting for work.\" \n\nThe district judge on the case was stumped over whether \"report for work\" includes call-in shifts, or if that phrase requires a physical presence at a scheduled time â€” California's law doesn't specify. Ultimately, the judge concluded that \"report for work\" requires physical attendance, and dismissed the call-in reporting time claim. In April, however, he essentially paused the case and gave lawyers for Casas and another ex-Victoria's Secret worker permission to appeal that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, which covers states including California, Nevada, Oregon, and Arizona, for an authoritative interpretation.\n\nThe district court said it hadn't found \"a single on-point case addressing a claim similar\" to Casas' reporting-time claim or \"more generally, interpreting what it means to 'report for work,'\" under California law. The investigation by the New York attorney general also centers around whether call-in scheduling violates state law that requires payment for each employee \"who by request or permission of the employer reports for work on any day.\" It's unclear whether the New York AG will make retailers pay for such shifts once the investigation is complete, but it is within his office's power to do so. \n\nThe stakes in both cases are high. Lawyers for Victoria's Secret said counting call-ins under current \"report for work\" requirements would cause \"profound legal, economic, and practical consequences\" for employers and employees throughout California. Leimbach said if the 9th Circuit accepts and evaluates the appeal, \"it would be the first major decision on this issue,\" and likely influential.\n\nA federal judge's interpretation could be cited in other states with similar laws that entitle workers to compensation for canceled shifts, especially those using the phrase \"report for work.\" Eight states, plus Washington, D.C., have similar laws, and while call-in scheduling has been noted as a problem by lawmakers in the handful of states like <a href=\"https://www.revisor.mn.gov/bills/bill.php?b=house&amp;f=HF1048&amp;ssn=0&amp;y=2015\">Minnesota<\/a> and <a href=\"https://olis.leg.state.or.us/liz/2015R1/Downloads/MeasureDocument/HB3377/Introduced\">Oregon<\/a> that are <a href=\"http://www.workplacesystems.com/blog/retailers-here-are-some-state-bills-to-keep-an-eye-on/\">considering so-called fair workweek legislation<\/a>, it's currently perfectly legal across the country. \n\nVictoria's Secret contends that a canceled call-in shift shouldn't merit any pay, mostly because it doesn't require employees to physically show up. The company is being asked to pay people \"for doing absolutely nothing compensable â€” for not physically reporting to any workplace and for not doing any work,\" the company's lawyers wrote in response to the suit. \n\nPhysically showing up is what draws the line between work and something else, the response suggests. An employee could make the phone call to check if they're needed \"while still in bed\" or \"having lunch over an hour away,\" lawyers for the chain argued.",

                     "description": "Despite the frustration and uncertainty, most low-wage workers can't afford to walk away from the companies that schedule work this way. The state of today's labor market and the eagerness of so many workers to get whatever hours they can find gives retailers the upper hand.\n\n\"I just wanted shifts, period,\" said Mitchell, the former Urban Outfitters employee. He started working part-time there shortly after he moved to Atlanta, until finding a steady 9-to-5 job in freight logistics.\n\nEven if he consistently hustled for 30 hours a week, it was hard to pay rent, he said, adding that he was on food stamps for six months. \n\nAn Urban Outfitters spokesperson, in an email to BuzzFeed News, said: \"We believe our policies are fully compliant with all applicable federal, state, and local laws while at the same time providing managers the flexibility to tailor schedules.\"\n\n\"A lot of people are working several part-time jobs, and if you're on-call, you can't work your other job at the same time,\" said Christine Berry, who worked as a sales associate and a manager at a Banana Republic in New Jersey between 2010 and 2014. \"You lost that time you could be working elsewhere.\" \n\nMany insist that in such an environment, protections historically applied to shift workers sent home ahead of schedule should be extended. \"If you've been published a schedule for your hypothetical call-in shift, if it's mandatory, not optional, and you had to tailor your life around the shift, yes, you are reporting for work,\" said Leimbach.\n\nHe added: \"Our view of these reporting time laws is that the purpose of these laws is to proscribe certain conduct, to prevent a certain kind of injustice from happening. When an employee tailors their life around a work schedule, you should adjust their wages if they're making themselves ready, willing and able to work.\"\n\nUnpredictability has become an unfortunate hallmark of the low-paying, part-time jobs at America's favorite shopping and dining chains in recent years â€” <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/08/13/us/starbucks-workers-scheduling-hours.html\">Starbucks<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/feature/in-plain-sight/shift-change-just-time-scheduling-creates-chaos-workers-n95881\">Ann Taylor Loft<\/a>, <a href=\"http://www.publicintegrity.org/2012/04/06/8608/call-employment-good-business-bad-workers\">Club Monaco<\/a>, and <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/13/on-call-shifts_n_2862566.html\">Banana Republic<\/a> have all been lambasted in national news stories for distributing schedules just days in advance, canceling shifts at the last minute, and keeping employees on a tight leash by way of call-in scheduling. But little has compelled them and their many rivals engaging in the same practices to change.\n\nThe flood of job-seekers that emerged during the recession, along with tremendous advances in scheduling software, has provided fertile ground for chains to test the boundaries of employee availability â€” especially as they manage lackluster sales in stores and new costs related to the Affordable Care Act. \n\nCraig Rowley, the global practice leader for retail at Hay Group, a management consultancy, said that beyond the ACA, the much larger factor in the rise of on-call scheduling has been the retail industry's volatile sales since the recession.\n\n\"Consumers are just unpredictable, when they will or won't buy,\" Rowley said. \"Gas prices are at a significant low right now, which frees up a lot of money in people's hands. You'd think retail sales would be up significantly because of that â€” they're not. When you ask economists, nobody can tell why people aren't shopping.\"\n\n\"It's a challenging dance in this industry, when you have the variability and unpredictability of sales that exist in today's economy,\" Rowley said. \"If sales aren't there, there's tremendous pressure to take expense out of the business.\" \n\nAllie McCullen, 25, who worked at an Urban Outfitters in Atlanta from late 2012 through last October, said hours were determined week by week \"in accordance with the previous week's sales.\"\n\n\"You could get a week with 20 hours and no on-call shifts,\" she said. \"And then if sales are bad, you could have one on-call shift and that's all you get.\"",

                     "description": "A spokesperson for the New York AG's office said <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2015/04/13/399414298/new-york-investigates-retailers-for-unpredictable-work-schedules\">the investigation<\/a>, which includes Urban Outfitters, Victoria's Secret, and Bath &amp; Body Works, is ongoing.\n\nBetween that and the California suit, retailers are holding their breath on what could become widely cited precedents.\n\nThey could also be very costly precedents. In the California case, lawyers for Victoria's Secret \"conservatively\" estimated that if the company were required to shell out at least two hours in wages for every call-in shift that an employee wasn't permitted to work between July 2010 and August 2014, it would cost $25.1 million.\n\nThat's just for part-timers in California, where the suit was filed. And while that estimated $25.1 million stretches across four years, California is home to just a fraction of the more than 900 Victoria's Secret stores in the U.S. (Its website lists 129 stores in the state.) That means the bill would be much higher nationally. And Victoria's Secret is far from the only large national retailer that would need to pay up.\n\nFor publicly traded retailers who have to answer to Wall Street on a quarterly basis, voluntarily giving up the savings tied to on-call scheduling is crazy talk. Most won't change unless they have to.\n\nIn one bright spot, San Francisco <a href=\"http://sfgsa.org/modules/showdocument.aspx?documentid=12778\">recently passed a<\/a> \"Retail Workers Bill of Rights,\" set to take hold next month, that's aimed at making worker schedules more predictable. Part of the legislation requires at least two hours of pay for call-in shifts unless an employer gives 24 hours' notice that it's been moved or canceled. Williams-Sonoma and Gap, both part of the New York AG's investigation, are headquartered in the city.\n\nPushing for a wider interpretation of reporting-time pay laws, such as the ones in New York and California, will be a stepping-stone toward a national solution, activists say, because such laws are only on the books in a handful of states. And even then, the Center for Law and Social Policy notes workers are frequently unaware they're entitled to such wages.\n\nThe stakes are high for hourly workers. For Kris Buchmann, who worked at Victoria's Secret from 2001 to 2002, getting paid for even one hour of canceled on-call shifts â€” she was paid $6.50 an hour back then â€” \"would have made a huge difference,\" she said. \n\n\"It wouldn't have been a huge sum of money, but it would have been a big deal to me â€¦Do you know how many packs of ramen you can buy with a dollar?\"",

But Einstein said the problem is that many consumers aren't aware of exactly how caloric a meal can become. She expects this will change when <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/LabelingNutrition/ucm436722.htm\">new FDA rules<\/a>, effective this December, require restaurant chains with 20 or more locations to label calories on menus. \n\nCSPI surveyed the menus of more than 200 restaurant chains. Here are some entrÃ©es, sides, drinks, and outlandish combos it highlighted for being abysmally high in calories, saturated fat, sodium, and sugar.",

Payments will employ \"near-field communication,\" or NFC, to allow users to pay for goods and services with a preloaded credit card by simply placing their phones near a merchant terminal. <\/p>\n\n<p>Burke said that Android Pay will be available in over 700,000 stores, including Macy&#39;s, Bloomingdale&#39;s, and McDonald&#39;s locations, in addition working within apps such as GrubHub, Uber, and Groupon. Payments can also be authorized with a user&#39;s fingerprint. At I/O, Burke said Payments would be available \"soon.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>Burke said Pay \"builds on work we did in previous Android releases,\" and indeed, Google first rolled out a payments service, then called Google Wallet, in 2011. But it never took off, as it wasn&#39;t available in many stores and a number of users didn&#39;t even realize they could make payments with their phone. Google recently acquired technology assets from SoftCard, formerly known as Isis, a mobile payments company founded by a consortium of wireless carriers. At the same time, <a href=\"http://googlecommerce.blogspot.com/2015/02/tap-tap-whos-there-google-wallet-and.html\">Google made a deal with carriers to have Google Wallet pre-installed on phones<\/a>. Google also has deals with the major credit card networks &mdash; American Express, Discover, MasterCard, and Visa &mdash; to support Android Pay.<\/p>\n\n<p>Right now, Apple Pay is the clear leader in mobile payments from consumers to merchants. Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/matthewzeitlin/apple-pay-expands#.opME8xB17\">said in January<\/a> that Apple Pay does $2 out of every $3 of contactless payments for MasterCard, American Express, and Visa. It has also successfully signed up major banks and merchants like Best Buy, Whole Foods, McDonald&#39;s and is available at nearly 700,000 merchant locations, Tim Cook said in March.<\/p>\n\n<p>But it&#39;s still a relatively small market. Forrester Research <a href=\"http://blogs.forrester.com/denee_carrington/14-11-17-us_mobile_payments_will_reach_142b_by_2019\">estimated that there were $52 billion of mobile payments in 2014<\/a>, which includes in-person payments, payments done through mobile apps remotely, and peer to payments like Venmo). 22 percent of cell phone owners made at least one mobile payment in 2014, and a third of cell phone users between aged 18 and 29 did, <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/matthewzeitlin/fed-says-mobile-payment-rising#.qx1MxEzke\">according to a Federal Reserve survey<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p>The main reason people don&#39;t use mobile payments, according to the Federal Reserve, is that they&#39;re not noticeably more convenient than credit or debit cards. 75 percent of the respondents in the Fed survey said that it was easier to pay with credit or debit cards, and 59 percent said they were concerned about the security of mobile payments. Like with Apple Pay, Android Pay will not convey a credit card number to the merchant, and will instead receive what&#39;s known as a unique token for each transaction.<\/p>\n\n\n <p><small><\/small><\/p>",

                     "description": "At today's I/O conference, Google Vice President of Engineering Dave Burke unveiled Android Pay, Google's new in-app and tap-to-pay mobile payments service. Payments will employ \"near-field communication,\" or NFC, to allow users to pay for goods and services with a preloaded credit card by simply placing their phones near a merchant terminal. \n\nBurke said that Android Pay will be available in over 700,000 stores, including Macy's, Bloomingdale's, and McDonald's locations, in addition working within apps such as GrubHub, Uber, and Groupon. Payments can also be authorized with a user's fingerprint. At I/O, Burke said Payments would be available \"soon.\"\n\nBurke said Pay \"builds on work we did in previous Android releases,\" and indeed, Google first rolled out a payments service, then called Google Wallet, in 2011. But it never took off, as it wasn't available in many stores and a number of users didn't even realize they could make payments with their phone. Google recently acquired technology assets from SoftCard, formerly known as Isis, a mobile payments company founded by a consortium of wireless carriers. At the same time, <a href=\"http://googlecommerce.blogspot.com/2015/02/tap-tap-whos-there-google-wallet-and.html\">Google made a deal with carriers to have Google Wallet pre-installed on phones<\/a>. Google also has deals with the major credit card networks â€” American Express, Discover, MasterCard, and Visa â€” to support Android Pay.\n\nRight now, Apple Pay is the clear leader in mobile payments from consumers to merchants. Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/matthewzeitlin/apple-pay-expands#.opME8xB17\">said in January<\/a> that Apple Pay does $2 out of every $3 of contactless payments for MasterCard, American Express, and Visa. It has also successfully signed up major banks and merchants like Best Buy, Whole Foods, McDonald's and is available at nearly 700,000 merchant locations, Tim Cook said in March.\n\nBut it's still a relatively small market. Forrester Research <a href=\"http://blogs.forrester.com/denee_carrington/14-11-17-us_mobile_payments_will_reach_142b_by_2019\">estimated that there were $52 billion of mobile payments in 2014<\/a>, which includes in-person payments, payments done through mobile apps remotely, and peer to payments like Venmo). 22 percent of cell phone owners made at least one mobile payment in 2014, and a third of cell phone users between aged 18 and 29 did, <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/matthewzeitlin/fed-says-mobile-payment-rising#.qx1MxEzke\">according to a Federal Reserve survey<\/a>. \n\nThe main reason people don't use mobile payments, according to the Federal Reserve, is that they're not noticeably more convenient than credit or debit cards. 75 percent of the respondents in the Fed survey said that it was easier to pay with credit or debit cards, and 59 percent said they were concerned about the security of mobile payments. Like with Apple Pay, Android Pay will not convey a credit card number to the merchant, and will instead receive what's known as a unique token for each transaction.",

One problem, Laguna Beach Mayor Pro Tem Steve Dicterow told BuzzFeed News, is that while currently only 60 properties in town have the proper permit for short-term rentals, which requires a business license and paying an occupancy tax, there are 200 properties listed on home sharing websites that do not. But an even bigger concern is the quality-of-life complaints made to the city regarding these properties.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"It needs some regulation because there have just been too many anecdotal stories of people not treating the neighbors well, being loud, having late, noisy parties, parking illegally in places, being rude to people, things of that nature,\" Dicterow said. <\/p>\n\n<p>\"These are in a residential neighborhood, not in a commercial or hotel district. The primary concern we have is that there have been a proliferation of these short-term rentals because of social media and the various websites that advertise these properties. Of course I want to collect the tax, but our primary concern is that residents who live there full-time can have the quiet enjoyment of the neighborhood to which they&#39;re entitled. Laguna is a small town.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>The Laguna Beach decision comes just a week after the Santa Monica City Council <a href=\"http://laist.com/2015/05/13/santa_monica_airbnb_ban.php\">approved a permanent ban on short-term rentals<\/a>, or those fewer than 30 days. Despite the fact that the decision spurred a protest organized by Airbnb outside of the City Council, local legislators said complaints of Airbnb causing an affordable housing shortage in Santa Monica were too forceful to ignore.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"When we in Santa Monica found that over 1,000 dwelling units that should be homes to permanent residents had been converted instead to de facto hotel rooms, we felt we had to act, and we all felt the same way about it,\" Santa Monica Mayor Kevin McKeown <a href=\"http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2015/05/12/santa-monica-may-close-the-door-on-airbnb-short-term-rentals/\">said<\/a> at the meeting.

In the end, it recommended the city continue its prohibition of short-term rentals, and will present a clarification of its zoning code laws &mdash; violations of which can result in a range of penalties, from a $200 fine to a misdemeanor charge &mdash; at the July City Council meeting, where it will likely go into effect 30 days later. Minnich said Airbnb was \"disappointed\" with the task force&#39;s findings.<\/p>\n\n<p>\"There were a lot of residents that were very concerned because they already had neighbors using short-term rentals and they were having parties,\" Genevieve Morrill, president of the West Hollywood Chamber of Commerce and a member of the task force, told BuzzFeed News. <\/p>\n\n<p>\"Other people were saying it helped us out and we get to travel by doing that, but it just seemed that even with looking at other cities, we are too dense.

Restaurant chains like <a href=\"https://chipotle.com/food-with-integrity#saying-no-to-drugs\">Chipotle<\/a> and <a href=\"http://news.mcdonalds.com/US/Media-Statements/Response-to-Antibiotics-in-Chicken\">McDonald's<\/a> and even mega-retailer <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/22/us-wal-mart-stores-antibiotics-idUSKBN0O71OV20150522\">Walmart<\/a> are trying to reduce the use of antibiotics in meat, for instance. Meanwhile, more grocery stores are stocking their shelves with such items to compete with retailers like Whole Foods. \n\nNatural foods is still a weakness for Hormel, which expects to make more than $9.7 billion in sales this year. Yet these sustainably-raised products are quickly gaining mainstream momentum, and Hormel is betting that this will translate to people buying a lot more organic bacon, hot dogs, sausages, and deli meats. \n\nThe $775 million deal will help New Jersey-based Applegate get more items into traditional grocery outlets (versus specialty food stores), and possibly even start selling its meats to foodservice operators, where it currently does not do any business. It \"provides us with a much more meaningful position in the natural and organic space,\" Hormel CEO Jeff Ettinger said during a conference call on Wednesday. \n\nHe expects Applegate's sales will continue to grow in the double digits annually, a faster rate than Hormel's as demand for responsibly raised meat rises. The brand estimates it will make just $340 million in 2015. \n\nAbout 70% of Applegate's products are \"natural\" (which the company defines as hormone-free, antibiotic-free, free of artificial ingredients, and starting July GMO-free as well) and 30% are organic.",

It added Doritos flavor to its taco shells. It folded a syrupy breakfast taco into a waffle shell, and later a biscuit. It wrapped a burrito inside a quesadilla and dubbed it the <a href=\"https://www.tacobell.com/food/menuitem/quesarito\">Quesarito<\/a>. Then it used <a href=\"http://www.capncrunch.com/default.aspx#product?s=crunchberries\">Cap&#39;N Crunch Berries<\/a> cereal to create a rainbow-colored donut hole. If there was a word to describe such flavor blasted franken-foods, \"natural\" wouldn&#39;t be one of them. <\/p>\n\n<p>So as other fast food chains made questionable commitments to making their menus healthier and removing unpronounceable ingredients from their food, you might have thought that Taco Bell would hold out, embrace its fast food roots, and admit that it doesn&#39;t give a crap about your diet. Because you never ate a Quesarito for your health. <\/p>\n\n<p>But you&#39;d be wrong. <\/p>\n\n<p>Taco Bell today announced a new set of standards for ingredients that will remove artificial colors, flavors, added trans fats, high fructose corn syrup, or \"unsustainable\" palm oil in its food by the end of 2015. \"In all cases, they will be replaced with natural alternatives,\" the company said in a release. That&#39;s right, natural.<\/p>\n\n<p>Taco Bell \"is committed to being a brand that people can truly champion and trust,\" CEO Brian Niccol told BuzzFeed News. While some of the replacement ingredients will cost more, the chain is not increasing menu prices. <\/p>\n\n<p>But there are some very significant exceptions. Most importantly, the changes won&#39;t affect beverages and co-branded items, so while artificial colors may be out of most foods, Doritos Locos Tacos and Cap&#39;N Crunch donut holes will be keeping Taco Bell&#39;s menus bright.<\/p>\n\n\n <p><small><\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\t\n\n\t \n\t\t  <iframe src=\"//instagram.com/p/znW4xywhMd/embed/\" height=\"710\" width=\"612\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" ><\/iframe>\n\t  \n\t\n\n\n <p><small><a rel=\"nofollow\"  target=\"_blank\"  href=\"http://instagram.com/p/znW4xywhMd/\">instagram.com<\/a><\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n <p>Pizza Hut, which like Taco Bell is owned by Yum Brands, also announced today that it plans to remove artificial flavors and colors from its pizzas by the end of July.

With a median rent of $1,197, it would require someone earning the average fresh graduate salary of $30,933 just half a roommate to make rent.\n\nSo if you <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3046400/how-to-be-a-success-at-everything/the-top-25-us-cities-for-jobs-this-year\">don't yet have a job<\/a> dictating where you'll start your career, it may be best to avoid the big coastal cities, which Trulia calls the \"high-wage metros.\" After all, New York's <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/11/as-is-an-old-new-york-apartment-on-the-l-e-s\">$1,795 shower-in-the-kitchen apartment<\/a> has recently been <a href=\"http://streeteasy.com/property/7890333-27-orchard-street-14\">taken off the market<\/a>.",

The LCA information has <a href=\"http://www.flcdatacenter.com/download.aspx\">long been available for download<\/a> from government-run sites. <\/p>\n\n<p>The database contains 5.2 million individual LCA records dating back to 2001, and lets users sort companies by total requests filed. Topping the list is Indian technology outsourcer Infosys, which has submitted almost 96,000 LCA requests since 2011, according to the database. <\/p>\n\n<p>Infosys did not immediately respond to a request for comment. <\/p>\n\n<p>The salary listed on this paperwork is not always the final salary of the employee, which can later be changed based on other factors. And not all LCA requests result in a worker making it to the U.S., due to annual caps on the number of H1-B and other skilled worker visas. <\/p>\n\n<p>But the database still gives a useful glimpse into compensation practices across companies and industries, showing the wages paid to a wide swath of skilled workers. While the H1-B visa is best known for its use by tech companies in recruiting foreign engineers, it is also widely used across businesses large and small when hiring all types of foreign professionals. <\/p>\n\n<p>The tool also highlights how the salaries of many foreign-born workers are exposed in a way that has no parallel for U.S. citizens and permanent residents (aside, of course, from <a href=\"http://governmentsalarydata.com\">government employees<\/a>). The tool is detailed enough that users may be able to identify individual workers with specific job titles within a given company, or those at companies that file relatively few LCAs.<\/p>\n\n<p>For example, the database shows the <i>New York Times<\/i> filed an LCA for a chief executive officer in 2015, <a href=\"http://data.jobsintech.io/companies/the-new-york-times-company/2015\">listing a salary of $1,000,000<\/a>.
