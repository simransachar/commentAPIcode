What would you say are the priorities for girls when they&#39;re looking for a guy to date? My personal experiences have led me to believe: 1) attractiveness, 2) income, 3) personality. But I would very much like your opinion, sir&#33; &mdash;<\/b>Matthew Quintero via Facebook<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-06/12/11/enhanced/webdr07/anigif_enhanced-mid-19901-1434122808-12.gif\" width=\"700\" height=\"450\" alt=\"\" /><\/p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Christine Hardtman / BuzzFeed<\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><b>Aziz Ansari:<\/b> I&#39;ve got to say, after speaking with a bunch of women for this book, the priorities are a nice guy that&rsquo;s clean. That&rsquo;s pretty much it &mdash; a nice guy that regularly showers. You&rsquo;re, like, the cream of the crop.<\/p><p>But truly, just doing basic nice things seem to go such a long way. With texting, for example, we asked, \"What kind of texts do guys send you?\" And all the women said guys would say just, &ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; &ldquo;Are you doing anything tonight?&rdquo; And if you&rsquo;re a guy saying that, it seems kind of innocuous. But in the context of a woman&rsquo;s phone &mdash; where there&rsquo;s all this other, similar nonsense from other guys &mdash; you just come off really boring. We kind of figured out if a guy just asks a woman to do a specific thing at a specific time, that was enough to make vaginas explode. The factors that made a perfect text from a guy were: asking someone to do a specific thing at a specific time, this was the main thing; another thing was having a little bit of sense of humor involved; and the third thing was having some callback to a previous interaction or conversation, to make the person feel like you were engaged with them, and this wasn&rsquo;t some generic text floating around. You had a real connection with them. Those are the things that really seem to get a good response.<\/p><p><b>2. How do I know if it&#39;s a date or just hanging out?<\/b> &mdash;Sofia Tana via Facebook<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-06/12/11/enhanced/webdr07/anigif_enhanced-mid-26497-1434122857-1.gif\" width=\"700\" height=\"450\" alt=\"\" /><\/p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Christine Hardtman / BuzzFeed<\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><b>AA:<\/b> Oh&#33; This was something that frustrated both men and women to no end &mdash; this idea of, well, what&rsquo;s happening here? Are we hanging out or going on a date? That was another thing a lot of the women we talked to were really frustrated by, when a guy says, \"Hey, let&rsquo;s hang out sometime&#33;\" Well, what the fuck does that mean? Are we hanging out and boning? Or hanging out and running errands? I don&rsquo;t know&#33; I think it&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s very frustrating, and I think it&rsquo;s so annoying. I feel like people are really busy, and to put in the time and go on what you think is a date and then find out it&rsquo;s a hangout? It&rsquo;s so frustrating. I&rsquo;ve been in that situation before.<\/p><p><b>3. Why do men get intimidated by women? And what can a woman who has been described as &ldquo;intimidating&rdquo; do to be considered less so without compromising who she is?<\/b> &mdash;<a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/jkjones\">jkjones<\/a> via BuzzFeed<\/p><p><b>AA:<\/b> I guess some guys are probably just scared of getting hurt, or scared that someone is going to be mean to them. I think that&rsquo;s where that&rsquo;s coming from. It&rsquo;s hard&#33; I don&rsquo;t know.<\/p><p><b>4. How do I deal with unrequited love? &mdash;<\/b><a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/maiiiworld\">maiiiworld<\/a> via BuzzFeed<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-06/12/11/enhanced/webdr05/anigif_enhanced-mid-12612-1434122905-1.gif\" width=\"700\" height=\"450\" alt=\"\" /><\/p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Christine Hardtman / BuzzFeed<\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><b>AA:<\/b> Oooh that&rsquo;s hard. Binge-watch a show and get a bunch of ice cream. Wanna see what <i>Bloodline<\/i>&rsquo;s all about?<\/p><p><b>5. I can never seal the deal with a girl. I always end up just being friends. Any advice?<\/b> &mdash;<a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/nfogie\">nfogie<\/a> via BuzzFeed<\/p><p><b>AA:<\/b> I think from our conversations with women, it seemed like the best thing to do is just being pretty straightforward about what you want in those texts &mdash; saying, \"Hey, it was fun hanging out, would love to go to that sushi restaurant we were talking about.\" Just that&#33; What&rsquo;s great is, with texts, you can craft something like that, and just send it, and you don&rsquo;t have to be very nervous, because you can write that at home. You just hit \"send\" and it&rsquo;s done. So just do that, and hopefully someone will be interested in what you&rsquo;re proposing.<\/p><p><b>6. How much can you rely on how someone interacts with you online/over text to gauge how much interest they have in you? I&rsquo;m never sure if it&rsquo;s reasonable to say, \"Oh, he could just be a bad texter,\" etc., about someone I&rsquo;m talking to. (You can make an excuse for anything.)<\/b> &mdash;<a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/christinegb\">christinegb<\/a> via BuzzFeed<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-06/12/11/enhanced/webdr05/anigif_enhanced-mid-12490-1434122992-22.gif\" width=\"700\" height=\"450\" alt=\"\" /><\/p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Christine Hardtman / BuzzFeed<\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><b>AA:<\/b> So this is another thing I thought was really interesting, talking to people who did online dating. They&rsquo;d want to message back and forth so much with people to see if they got a vibe, and it&rsquo;s like, well, none of that matters. Just see them in person, and see if something&rsquo;s there. That was our big takeaway from online dating. You don&rsquo;t meet the perfect person online&mdash; you can meet a person online, but to find out if they&rsquo;re the perfect person you have to see them in person and really get a sense of what&rsquo;s going on. Because otherwise you&rsquo;re just sitting there messaging people; you don&rsquo;t want to be sitting in front of your screen all day trying to find this perfect person. Just meet someone in real life, and if there&rsquo;s no connection, whatever, move on. I feel like you only really get a connection with someone in person, no matter how you&rsquo;re finding them &mdash; site, app, whatever.<\/p><p><b>7. Does the person who sends the last text always lose? Is it even more of a loser move to send a follow-up text to that last text? Ugh.<\/b> &mdash;<a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/whatwhatwhatwhatwhatwhat\">whatwhatwhatwhatwhatwhat<\/a> via BuzzFeed<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-06/12/11/enhanced/webdr03/anigif_enhanced-mid-11463-1434123040-1.gif\" width=\"700\" height=\"450\" alt=\"\" /><\/p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Christine Hardtman / BuzzFeed<\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><b>AA:<\/b> Yeah. I feel like the person who sends the last text loses, for sure&#33; I mean, that&rsquo;s just the unofficial rule. If you send the last text, you lose. All those games exist because, psychologically, they work. If you&rsquo;re a woman and you meet three guys and two of them text you back the next day, they&rsquo;ve kind of put your mind at ease. And the third guy&rsquo;s in your mind the most because you&rsquo;re like, &ldquo;Why the fuck hasn&rsquo;t this guy written back? What&rsquo;s going on with him?&rdquo; So he has an increasing presence in your mind, and that can lead to feelings of attraction, just having that presence there. It&rsquo;s annoying that that stuff works, but it kind of does. Other times, though, it goes too far, and then you just get pissed off at the person who hasn&rsquo;t written you back, or who just takes too long. It&rsquo;s kind of weird finding that middle ground, but a little bit of that stuff does work; it&rsquo;s just the way our minds work. We want what we can&rsquo;t have. All those basic psychological principles, it&rsquo;s hard to fight.<\/p><p><b>8. Should you block/delete/unfriend after a breakup?<\/b> &mdash;<a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/biancaibanezb\">biancaibanezb<\/a> via BuzzFeed<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-06/12/11/enhanced/webdr03/anigif_enhanced-mid-11475-1434123081-1.gif\" width=\"700\" height=\"450\" alt=\"\" /><\/p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Christine Hardtman / BuzzFeed<\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><b>AA:<\/b> It&rsquo;s harder to break up now, a lot of people told us, because you can&rsquo;t escape your exes. They live on in your phone world. They&rsquo;re on your Instagram account, they&rsquo;re on your Facebook page, and, even if you unfriend them, they&rsquo;re friends with some of your friends. You still see them. And so many people are compelled to see what their exes are up to. The most interesting lady &mdash; I think this was actually on BuzzFeed [<i>Eds. note: <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/rossalynwarren/a-girl-is-getting-over-her-ex-by-photoshopping-photos-of-bey#.cx33a3A8w\"><i>It was&#33;<\/i><\/a><\/i>] &mdash; this woman said that she took all her old photos of her and her boyfriend, and she photoshopped Beyonc&eacute; over all the pictures of her boyfriend. Now all those memories are Beyonc&eacute;-fied. We did that in the book, too. So if you have a photo of, say, you and your boyfriend on a trip to Hawaii, photoshop someone else over your boyfriend, like maybe Sonia Sotomayor. Or you&rsquo;re at the beach&mdash; not with your boyfriend, but with Jason Statham.<\/p><p><b>Right, because what if they&rsquo;re good pictures of you?<\/b><br /><\/p><p><b>AA:<\/b> Yeah, you don&rsquo;t want to lose those memories. You just recraft better memories. Oh, remember the time I went to the Statue of Liberty with Jon Snow?<\/p><p><b>9. What are the &ldquo;red flags&rdquo; in a relationship that you look for, to know a relationship is not going to work out?<\/b> &mdash;<a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/supalexandra\">supalexandra<\/a> via BuzzFeed<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-06/12/11/enhanced/webdr09/anigif_enhanced-mid-24590-1434123115-18.gif\" width=\"700\" height=\"450\" alt=\"\" /><\/p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Christine Hardtman / BuzzFeed<\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><b>AA:<\/b> Some flags I look out for in general are Confederate flags. If you see those, that&rsquo;s probably not good. If you go to the guy&rsquo;s place and he has a huge Confederate flag &mdash; a Confederate flag is a red flag.<\/p><p><b>10. What&rsquo;s the deal with the &ldquo;check-in&rdquo; text, aka when a guy only wants to text you once a week to check in and see how you&rsquo;re doing but then never talks to you otherwise/asks to hang out?<\/b><\/p><p><b>AA:<\/b> That&rsquo;s the perfect example of the bozo text that a lot of ladies seem to be frustrated by, which is just like, &ldquo;Hey, what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; And again, if you&rsquo;re a dude &mdash; if you just say, \"Hey, let&rsquo;s go do this specific thing, at this specific time,\" you&rsquo;ll have such a better chance of actually meeting up. I feel like a lot of guys doing that check=in thing &mdash; women are, as well &mdash; are just keeping their options open. Instead of saying,\"Hey, let&rsquo;s meet up at this place tonight,\" it&rsquo;s easier to be like, &ldquo;What are you doing tonight?&rdquo; And then you&#39;re thinking, &ldquo;Oh, well that sounds fun, but let me see what these other people are doing as well.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s such a bad mentality we all have, of trying to find the funnest thing. I have these people in my world, and I have to make sure I&#39;m hanging out with the funnest person, doing the funnest thing, so let me just <i>lightly<\/i> see what people are up to &mdash; and then you just end up doing nothing at home.<\/p><p><b>11. How does a girl ask out a random guy, without sounding like a creepy and desperate cat lady?<\/b><\/p><p><b>AA:<\/b> I think as long as you don&rsquo;t ask the guy to come play with all 30 of your cats at your house, you won&rsquo;t come off that way. Of the guys I talked to, a lot of them &mdash; well, there are some guys that are like, &ldquo;Oh yeah, I don&rsquo;t like it when girls ask me out\" &mdash; but most guys said, &ldquo;Oh, that would be so refreshing&#33;&rdquo; It&#39;s the same thing as for guys. If you invite people to a specific thing that sounds interesting, I think you&rsquo;re in pretty good shape.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-06/12/11/enhanced/webdr03/anigif_enhanced-mid-11463-1434123232-8.gif\" width=\"700\" height=\"450\" alt=\"\" /><\/p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Christine Hardtman / BuzzFeed<\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>One thing we came up with &mdash; just generally about dates, both for men and women &mdash; was the idea that we have so many options, and we&rsquo;re horrible at analyzing them. Because the way we analyze our romantic options is with these pretty boring standard first dates. Like, \"Oh, let&#39;s get a coffee, let&rsquo;s get dinner,\" and then they just end becoming these boring resume exchanges. You&rsquo;re trying to find this amazing person, and it&rsquo;s really hard for anyone to live up to that in that kind of situation. We came up with something called the \"Monster Truck Rally Theory,\" which is basically from when I was talking to this sociologist from Stanford, who told me that he and some of his buddies started taking people out on dates to monster truck rallies. And it was really fun, and it was different, and they got a much better sense of what it was really like to be with this person because you got a sense of what their vibe was, what their sense of humor was, and it wasn&rsquo;t just like, [<i>robot voice<\/i>] &ldquo;Uhh, my sibling goes to Duke, and I have a brother who&rsquo;s also a lawyer in Jersey,&rdquo; you know? It was a fun thing. The idea is to do different, fun activities on dates that would be interesting even to do just by yourself. Not just, let&rsquo;s get a coffee and discuss where we grew up.<\/p><p><b>12. When did it become OK to simply stop responding to someone&#39;s calls/texts (as opposed to saying you&rsquo;re no longer interested)? Is there any hope that generation internet-dating can return from doucheweed land? Even a bad excuse would be better than radio silence.<\/b><\/p><p><b>AA:<\/b> Oh, people hate silence, and so many people do it. I hate silence, and I did that while I was dating. It&rsquo;s just easy, and you don&rsquo;t have to get into a confrontation. It&#39;s really frustrating. I think it&rsquo;s hard to craft that honest text. I remember one girl sent me one, like, that one time &mdash; it was a very honest thing &mdash; and I thought that was so nice and thoughtful. But generally, people fade out. I think what people like the most, though, is when you&rsquo;re not part of the equation, where it&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m moving.&rdquo; So instead of silence, just tell people you&rsquo;re moving to Sweden. Or you&rsquo;re training to be an astronaut. Just something where you&rsquo;re not available, so that way you&rsquo;re not hurting anyone&rsquo;s feelings, and they won&rsquo;t keep hitting you up, because you&rsquo;re gone.

What would you say are the priorities for girls when they&#39;re looking for a guy to date? My personal experiences have led me to believe: 1) attractiveness, 2) income, 3) personality. But I would very much like your opinion, sir&#33; &mdash;<\/b>Matthew Quintero via Facebook<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-06/12/11/enhanced/webdr07/anigif_enhanced-mid-19901-1434122808-12.gif\" width=\"700\" height=\"450\" alt=\"\" /><\/p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Christine Hardtman / BuzzFeed<\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><b>Aziz Ansari:<\/b> I&#39;ve got to say, after speaking with a bunch of women for this book, the priorities are a nice guy that&rsquo;s clean. That&rsquo;s pretty much it &mdash; a nice guy that regularly showers. You&rsquo;re, like, the cream of the crop.<\/p><p>But truly, just doing basic nice things seem to go such a long way. With texting, for example, we asked, \"What kind of texts do guys send you?\" And all the women said guys would say just, &ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; &ldquo;Are you doing anything tonight?&rdquo; And if you&rsquo;re a guy saying that, it seems kind of innocuous. But in the context of a woman&rsquo;s phone &mdash; where there&rsquo;s all this other, similar nonsense from other guys &mdash; you just come off really boring. We kind of figured out if a guy just asks a woman to do a specific thing at a specific time, that was enough to make vaginas explode. The factors that made a perfect text from a guy were: asking someone to do a specific thing at a specific time, this was the main thing; another thing was having a little bit of sense of humor involved; and the third thing was having some callback to a previous interaction or conversation, to make the person feel like you were engaged with them, and this wasn&rsquo;t some generic text floating around. You had a real connection with them. Those are the things that really seem to get a good response.<\/p><p><b>2. How do I know if it&#39;s a date or just hanging out?<\/b> &mdash;Sofia Tana via Facebook<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-06/12/11/enhanced/webdr07/anigif_enhanced-mid-26497-1434122857-1.gif\" width=\"700\" height=\"450\" alt=\"\" /><\/p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Christine Hardtman / BuzzFeed<\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><b>AA:<\/b> Oh&#33; This was something that frustrated both men and women to no end &mdash; this idea of, well, what&rsquo;s happening here? Are we hanging out or going on a date? That was another thing a lot of the women we talked to were really frustrated by, when a guy says, \"Hey, let&rsquo;s hang out sometime&#33;\" Well, what the fuck does that mean? Are we hanging out and boning? Or hanging out and running errands? I don&rsquo;t know&#33; I think it&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s very frustrating, and I think it&rsquo;s so annoying. I feel like people are really busy, and to put in the time and go on what you think is a date and then find out it&rsquo;s a hangout? It&rsquo;s so frustrating. I&rsquo;ve been in that situation before.<\/p><p><b>3. Why do men get intimidated by women? And what can a woman who has been described as &ldquo;intimidating&rdquo; do to be considered less so without compromising who she is?<\/b> &mdash;<a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/jkjones\">jkjones<\/a> via BuzzFeed<\/p><p><b>AA:<\/b> I guess some guys are probably just scared of getting hurt, or scared that someone is going to be mean to them. I think that&rsquo;s where that&rsquo;s coming from. It&rsquo;s hard&#33; I don&rsquo;t know.<\/p><p><b>4.

Binge-watch a show and get a bunch of ice cream. Wanna see what <i>Bloodline<\/i>&rsquo;s all about?<\/p><p><b>5. I can never seal the deal with a girl. I always end up just being friends. Any advice?<\/b> &mdash;<a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/nfogie\">nfogie<\/a> via BuzzFeed<\/p><p><b>AA:<\/b> I think from our conversations with women, it seemed like the best thing to do is just being pretty straightforward about what you want in those texts &mdash; saying, \"Hey, it was fun hanging out, would love to go to that sushi restaurant we were talking about.\" Just that&#33; What&rsquo;s great is, with texts, you can craft something like that, and just send it, and you don&rsquo;t have to be very nervous, because you can write that at home. You just hit \"send\" and it&rsquo;s done. So just do that, and hopefully someone will be interested in what you&rsquo;re proposing.<\/p><p><b>6. How much can you rely on how someone interacts with you online/over text to gauge how much interest they have in you? I&rsquo;m never sure if it&rsquo;s reasonable to say, \"Oh, he could just be a bad texter,\" etc., about someone I&rsquo;m talking to. (You can make an excuse for anything.)<\/b> &mdash;<a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/christinegb\">christinegb<\/a> via BuzzFeed<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-06/12/11/enhanced/webdr05/anigif_enhanced-mid-12490-1434122992-22.gif\" width=\"700\" height=\"450\" alt=\"\" /><\/p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Christine Hardtman / BuzzFeed<\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><b>AA:<\/b> So this is another thing I thought was really interesting, talking to people who did online dating. They&rsquo;d want to message back and forth so much with people to see if they got a vibe, and it&rsquo;s like, well, none of that matters. Just see them in person, and see if something&rsquo;s there. That was our big takeaway from online dating. You don&rsquo;t meet the perfect person online&mdash; you can meet a person online, but to find out if they&rsquo;re the perfect person you have to see them in person and really get a sense of what&rsquo;s going on. Because otherwise you&rsquo;re just sitting there messaging people; you don&rsquo;t want to be sitting in front of your screen all day trying to find this perfect person. Just meet someone in real life, and if there&rsquo;s no connection, whatever, move on. I feel like you only really get a connection with someone in person, no matter how you&rsquo;re finding them &mdash; site, app, whatever.<\/p><p><b>7. Does the person who sends the last text always lose? Is it even more of a loser move to send a follow-up text to that last text? Ugh.<\/b> &mdash;<a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/whatwhatwhatwhatwhatwhat\">whatwhatwhatwhatwhatwhat<\/a> via BuzzFeed<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-06/12/11/enhanced/webdr03/anigif_enhanced-mid-11463-1434123040-1.gif\" width=\"700\" height=\"450\" alt=\"\" /><\/p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Christine Hardtman / BuzzFeed<\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><b>AA:<\/b> Yeah. I feel like the person who sends the last text loses, for sure&#33; I mean, that&rsquo;s just the unofficial rule. If you send the last text, you lose. All those games exist because, psychologically, they work. If you&rsquo;re a woman and you meet three guys and two of them text you back the next day, they&rsquo;ve kind of put your mind at ease. And the third guy&rsquo;s in your mind the most because you&rsquo;re like, &ldquo;Why the fuck hasn&rsquo;t this guy written back? What&rsquo;s going on with him?&rdquo; So he has an increasing presence in your mind, and that can lead to feelings of attraction, just having that presence there. It&rsquo;s annoying that that stuff works, but it kind of does. Other times, though, it goes too far, and then you just get pissed off at the person who hasn&rsquo;t written you back, or who just takes too long. It&rsquo;s kind of weird finding that middle ground, but a little bit of that stuff does work; it&rsquo;s just the way our minds work. We want what we can&rsquo;t have. All those basic psychological principles, it&rsquo;s hard to fight.<\/p><p><b>8.

They live on in your phone world. They&rsquo;re on your Instagram account, they&rsquo;re on your Facebook page, and, even if you unfriend them, they&rsquo;re friends with some of your friends. You still see them. And so many people are compelled to see what their exes are up to. The most interesting lady &mdash; I think this was actually on BuzzFeed [<i>Eds. note: <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/rossalynwarren/a-girl-is-getting-over-her-ex-by-photoshopping-photos-of-bey#.cx33a3A8w\"><i>It was&#33;<\/i><\/a><\/i>] &mdash; this woman said that she took all her old photos of her and her boyfriend, and she photoshopped Beyonc&eacute; over all the pictures of her boyfriend. Now all those memories are Beyonc&eacute;-fied. We did that in the book, too. So if you have a photo of, say, you and your boyfriend on a trip to Hawaii, photoshop someone else over your boyfriend, like maybe Sonia Sotomayor. Or you&rsquo;re at the beach&mdash; not with your boyfriend, but with Jason Statham.<\/p><p><b>Right, because what if they&rsquo;re good pictures of you?<\/b><br /><\/p><p><b>AA:<\/b> Yeah, you don&rsquo;t want to lose those memories. You just recraft better memories. Oh, remember the time I went to the Statue of Liberty with Jon Snow?<\/p><p><b>9. What are the &ldquo;red flags&rdquo; in a relationship that you look for, to know a relationship is not going to work out?<\/b> &mdash;<a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/supalexandra\">supalexandra<\/a> via BuzzFeed<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-06/12/11/enhanced/webdr09/anigif_enhanced-mid-24590-1434123115-18.gif\" width=\"700\" height=\"450\" alt=\"\" /><\/p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Christine Hardtman / BuzzFeed<\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><b>AA:<\/b> Some flags I look out for in general are Confederate flags. If you see those, that&rsquo;s probably not good. If you go to the guy&rsquo;s place and he has a huge Confederate flag &mdash; a Confederate flag is a red flag.<\/p><p><b>10. What&rsquo;s the deal with the &ldquo;check-in&rdquo; text, aka when a guy only wants to text you once a week to check in and see how you&rsquo;re doing but then never talks to you otherwise/asks to hang out?<\/b><\/p><p><b>AA:<\/b> That&rsquo;s the perfect example of the bozo text that a lot of ladies seem to be frustrated by, which is just like, &ldquo;Hey, what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; And again, if you&rsquo;re a dude &mdash; if you just say, \"Hey, let&rsquo;s go do this specific thing, at this specific time,\" you&rsquo;ll have such a better chance of actually meeting up. I feel like a lot of guys doing that check=in thing &mdash; women are, as well &mdash; are just keeping their options open. Instead of saying,\"Hey, let&rsquo;s meet up at this place tonight,\" it&rsquo;s easier to be like, &ldquo;What are you doing tonight?&rdquo; And then you&#39;re thinking, &ldquo;Oh, well that sounds fun, but let me see what these other people are doing as well.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s such a bad mentality we all have, of trying to find the funnest thing. I have these people in my world, and I have to make sure I&#39;m hanging out with the funnest person, doing the funnest thing, so let me just <i>lightly<\/i> see what people are up to &mdash; and then you just end up doing nothing at home.<\/p><p><b>11. How does a girl ask out a random guy, without sounding like a creepy and desperate cat lady?<\/b><\/p><p><b>AA:<\/b> I think as long as you don&rsquo;t ask the guy to come play with all 30 of your cats at your house, you won&rsquo;t come off that way. Of the guys I talked to, a lot of them &mdash; well, there are some guys that are like, &ldquo;Oh yeah, I don&rsquo;t like it when girls ask me out\" &mdash; but most guys said, &ldquo;Oh, that would be so refreshing&#33;&rdquo; It&#39;s the same thing as for guys. If you invite people to a specific thing that sounds interesting, I think you&rsquo;re in pretty good shape.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-06/12/11/enhanced/webdr03/anigif_enhanced-mid-11463-1434123232-8.gif\" width=\"700\" height=\"450\" alt=\"\" /><\/p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Christine Hardtman / BuzzFeed<\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>One thing we came up with &mdash; just generally about dates, both for men and women &mdash; was the idea that we have so many options, and we&rsquo;re horrible at analyzing them. Because the way we analyze our romantic options is with these pretty boring standard first dates. Like, \"Oh, let&#39;s get a coffee, let&rsquo;s get dinner,\" and then they just end becoming these boring resume exchanges. You&rsquo;re trying to find this amazing person, and it&rsquo;s really hard for anyone to live up to that in that kind of situation. We came up with something called the \"Monster Truck Rally Theory,\" which is basically from when I was talking to this sociologist from Stanford, who told me that he and some of his buddies started taking people out on dates to monster truck rallies. And it was really fun, and it was different, and they got a much better sense of what it was really like to be with this person because you got a sense of what their vibe was, what their sense of humor was, and it wasn&rsquo;t just like, [<i>robot voice<\/i>] &ldquo;Uhh, my sibling goes to Duke, and I have a brother who&rsquo;s also a lawyer in Jersey,&rdquo; you know? It was a fun thing. The idea is to do different, fun activities on dates that would be interesting even to do just by yourself. Not just, let&rsquo;s get a coffee and discuss where we grew up.<\/p><p><b>12. When did it become OK to simply stop responding to someone&#39;s calls/texts (as opposed to saying you&rsquo;re no longer interested)? Is there any hope that generation internet-dating can return from doucheweed land? Even a bad excuse would be better than radio silence.<\/b><\/p><p><b>AA:<\/b> Oh, people hate silence, and so many people do it. I hate silence, and I did that while I was dating. It&rsquo;s just easy, and you don&rsquo;t have to get into a confrontation. It&#39;s really frustrating. I think it&rsquo;s hard to craft that honest text. I remember one girl sent me one, like, that one time &mdash; it was a very honest thing &mdash; and I thought that was so nice and thoughtful. But generally, people fade out. I think what people like the most, though, is when you&rsquo;re not part of the equation, where it&rsquo;s like, &ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m moving.&rdquo; So instead of silence, just tell people you&rsquo;re moving to Sweden. Or you&rsquo;re training to be an astronaut. Just something where you&rsquo;re not available, so that way you&rsquo;re not hurting anyone&rsquo;s feelings, and they won&rsquo;t keep hitting you up, because you&rsquo;re gone.

I know it's harder to do it in person, but it's the better choice. Do not leave any kind of written or recorded trail.\"",

Those things exist on the internet, just like neo-nazis lurk on the internet. \n\nThe reason why this makes a writer like John Green back away from Tumblr is because it insisted on climbing in his internet space. It didn't just exist out there, being hateful and weird, out of sight, for the entertainment (?) of like-minded individuals. \n\nHe was tagged in it. It was placed in his feed for his perusal. ... The hate is hand-delivered, with vicious joy: the creator is made to watch themselves being hung, drawn, and quartered. \n\nAll the kudos in the world don't make up for scrolling through your Tumblr feed or inbox and discovering you've been disemboweled yet again. You can have your own opinions on Green's books and internet presence, but the fact remains that he is a very real positive influence on thousands of teens.

Fifteen years after the original <i>Princess Diaries<\/i> book was published, the author is back with two new novels to include in the best-selling series: <i>Royal Wedding<\/i> and <i>From The Notebooks of a Middle School Princess<\/i>.<\/p>\n\n<p>In <i>Royal Wedding<\/i>, readers get to learn about Princess Mia Thermopolis as a full-fledged adult who now lives in New York City, planning a future with her longtime boyfriend, Michael. Adding to the expected chaos that her lifestyle brings, Mia discovers she has a younger sister named Olivia. Both <i>Royal Wedding<\/i> and <i>From The Notebooks of a Middle School Princess<\/i> tell the story &mdash; from juxtaposed perspectives &mdash; of two sisters who are just trying to do what Mia&#39;s always tried to do: figure everything out.<\/p>\n\n<p>BuzzFeed had the chance to catch up with Cabot and talk about her new novels, weddings, and the double standards that women face. Here&#39;s what she had to say:<\/p>\n\n\n <p><small><\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n <p><b>It&#39;s been six years since you published your last <i>Princess Diaries<\/i> book and 15 years since the whole series started. What made you want to write <i>Royal Wedding<\/i>?<\/b><\/p>\n\n<p><b>Meg Cabot:<\/b> My first book was published in 1998, and I&#39;ve had multiple books come out every year since then, so I took last year off as a sabbatical because I was really tired. I had a lot of time to think about what I was doing with my life and I decided, I&#39;m just going to do what I want, because why not? But then after taking some time off I decided that I missed writing the <i>Princess Diaries<\/i> books &mdash; also, the 15th anniversary was coming up &mdash; so I decided to write another one. They&#39;re really fun and it&#39;s been 15 years so I figured, why not do an anniversary edition? The first book in <i>The Mediator<\/i> series [a collection of six novels about a teen girl ghost hunter who falls in love with the ghost who lives in her bedroom] also came out in 2002, so I&#39;m also going to publish an anniversary edition of that book, which doesn&#39;t come out until February. Those two novels, as well as <i>From The Notebooks of a Middle School Princess<\/i>, ended up being the books I wrote when I was on my sabbatical, even though I technically wasn&#39;t supposed to be working. But it was my sabbatical and that&#39;s what I wanted to do. I know it&#39;s totally geeky that on your sabbatical you would want to write, but that&#39;s what I did, because that&#39;s what I love to do.<\/p>\n\n<p><b>How long did it take you to write <i>Royal Wedding<\/i>?<\/b><\/p>\n\n<p><b>MC:<\/b> I probably started writing it in October 2013. Since it&#39;s a diary, a lot of the material and story is essentially my own writing. I used to keep a blog where I wrote down a lot of my own thoughts, but I stopped doing that as much now that social media is such a big deal and I&#39;m always on Twitter and Facebook. So instead, I&#39;ve just started putting my own thoughts into Princess Mia&#39;s diary.<\/p>\n\n<p><b>Did you put a lot of yourself into the book?<\/b><\/p>\n\n<p><b>MC:<\/b> Yes, I have to say there&#39;s a lot of me in Princess Mia.

A lot of the readers who started reading the books in 2000 when it first came out are now about 25 years old, which is close to Mia&#39;s age. I hear from a lot of those readers about what they&#39;re doing with their lives; a lot of them are getting married, not necessarily all of them but a lot of them, and most of them are also starting careers. That&#39;s also what&#39;s going on in Mia&#39;s life; she now has her career after opening a community youth center in New York City and is engaged to get married. It&#39;s interesting to hear about different readers&#39; struggles &mdash; a lot of them have graduated from college and are seeing what the real world is like. I thought that&#39;d be interesting, too, to describe from Mia&#39;s point of view. And now they&#39;ve discovered that people&#39;s cognitive functions aren&#39;t fully working until they&#39;re 26, which means you&#39;re basically still an adolescent until then.

I wanted to really comment on that because you see it a lot with younger generations; young women — especially young women who are celebrities — are held up to this standard that's impossible to live by, and I wanted to reflect that in the book. I got a lot of criticism about my books from people who had read <i>The Princess Diaries<\/i> after they'd seen the movie. The Disney movie was rated G, so it was really watered down from the books; in the books, Mia's parents are not married and she was illegitimate. A lot of parents of young readers were upset about that because they didn't want their kids to read about that lifestyle. The book has been banned a lot of times and people were upset at the fact that Mia lives with her single mom who openly had sex with this guy she wasn't married to — Mia's teacher — because they said it set a horrible example. I got a lot of crap for it, even from some of my own family members. They said I was promoting this horrible example of somebody who we should not be showing as a positive role model. It was really disturbing to me.\n\n<b>What would you say to someone who played a role in banning your books?<\/b>\n\n<b>MC:<\/b> I actually got hate mail and death threats, but it didn't scare me because it was so ludicrous. That's why I wrote <i>The Princess Diaries<\/i> in the first place, because I wanted to put that out there, that slut-shaming and criticizing women, is so dumb. I can't even verbalize how stupid I thought it was; I didn't think anyone would be upset about that. But there are people who are really upset. They didn't think this was something that girls should see because they said it perpetrated a female role model that is dangerous to young women, because apparently young women should just stay home, not be educated, and never go out on dates ever.\n\n<b>We also meet Olivia, Mia's younger sister, in <i>Royal Wedding<\/i>. What was behind your decision to include her character?<\/b>\n\n<b>MC:<\/b> A big part of the story is about family. My family is diverse and it turns out Mia's family is diverse, too. I think that's true for a lot of families now; it always was but even more so now. Mia finds out that her dad has another child that she did not know about who is biracial, and I have a biracial brother. Families don't look the same as they used to, and I wanted that to be reflected in the book, especially with the royal family.\n\n<b>What was it like to write about Olivia? How was writing Olivia's character different than Mia's?<\/b>\n\n<b>MC:<\/b> I wanted to make Olivia as different from Mia as I possibly could because she represents a different generation, and this book is for younger readers. She's super into drawing, which Mia wasn't, and she's coming into her own. Olivia's also from New Jersey, not New York City; she didn't grow up with this super-feminist mom who's an artist in Greenwich Village like Mia. Instead, Olivia grew up with a totally different kind of family, and she's pretty happy overall. She's not neurotic like Princess Mia, who's completely obsessed with the fact that she probably has a life-threatening disease most of the time, which is also like me. Olivia's not allowed computer access in her family, which I think is probably really good; we should all get off the computer more often. She just goes outside and plays, and she also draws. It was kind of a relief to write a character like that.\n\n<b>Do you relate more to Mia versus Olivia?<\/b>\n\n<b>MC:<\/b> I do, but it's bad; I wish I could be more like Olivia. Olivia's more of an aspirational character for me because she's who I wish I was, and Mia is unfortunately more like me — although, Mia was a vegetarian for a long time in the book series, which is also aspirational to me. But I can draw and Olivia draws, so it was really fun to write about a character who illustrates and is artistic. Olivia also gets along really well with Mia's grandmother; she thinks she's cool, which is weird.",

                     "description": "<b>You published both <i>Royal Wedding<\/i> and <i>From The Notebooks of a Middle School Princess<\/i> at the same time, and both Mia and Olivia's stories are paralleled. Did you write the two books at the same time?<\/b>\n\n<b>MC:<\/b> I had to because the action in both the books takes place at the same time, so I had to make sure that it all coincided and linked up together. I had to write from two people's point of views. It was really fun; it was a fun challenge. I had to make sure that all the copy edits went together. I have a couple of friends who are not writers but are voracious readers, so I had them read through the books and make sure that everything made sense. My mom also loves to read and was very helpful. Everybody caught different things that were wrong in the original drafts, which was great, and my mom caught the most.\n\n<b>What was it like to write 26-year-old Mia compared to 16-year-old Mia?<\/b>\n\n<b>MC:<\/b> I pulled back some of Mia's adolescent personality as a 26-year-old; I toned down her neurotic obsessions because I figure she's more mature now and she's actually happier in her life than she was at 16. When she was younger, she was very unhappy with a lot of things. I toned down the obsession with illnesses and I made her friends slightly more mature, too. Well, Lily was also less of a weirdo. Which actually happened. Lily's kind of based on a true person, she's based on a couple people, but they got less freakish as they got older. Everybody does; as you get older, you chill out more.\n\n<b>Both Mia and Olivia journal as a way to de-stress. Is this something you also do in real life? Would you recommend it to other people?<\/b>\n\n<b>MC:<\/b> I do, I have a journal that I handwrite in, and I've always done that. I do recommend it to people; I think it's a good way to get out your anger issues, especially with various family members or anyone else who's bugging you. That was actually first recommended to me by my grandma, who was originally the person who gave me my Holly Hobby diary. But then my brothers broke into it, so I started writing a fake diary with crazy stuff in it that I knew they'd find. When I was 10 years old, I pretended that I was an alien and I had been kidnapped and brought to Earth, and I was acting like a clone version of myself. They were too dumb to understand what was actually going on, but eventually they told my mom, \"Meg's an alien,\" so I got in trouble. But I've always kept a journal that I keep hidden. I usually only write in my journal when something really bad is going on or when I'm really mad about something. I don't write in it every day because I think if you make yourself do it, then it's worthless and boring. Only do it when you're really mad about something. I think I'm motivated by anger a lot, so I generally only write in it if I'm mad.\n\n<b>What was it like to contribute your own illustrations for <i>From The Notebooks of a Middle School Princess<\/i>?<\/b>\n\n<b>MC:<\/b> I'm so happy that Macmillan was so open to that. It was a little weird for me though because initially I thought I could just draw whatever I want. I like drawing girls in dresses and dogs and cats, but the publishing house obviously needed me to be more structured. They'd tell me they needed me to draw a private jet on one page and a limousine on another, which aren't things that I knew how to draw. I just never drew them in my life before, so that was really traumatic. I had to do a lot of sketches of those to get them right — I wasn't used to that part. When I worked as an illustrator, I would have to draw what people said. I did not like that part; I wanted to draw what I wanted. But it's about more than just doing what I want because it's really important to the narrative. I had to print out so many pictures of a limo in order to actually draw it because I don't use a computer or illustrative technology; I hand-drew it, and it was horrifying. We didn't have that technology back when I was in school and learning to draw right onto computers and sketch pads. I don't really think [the publishers] knew that's what I was really doing, so they'd come back with notes asking if I could make her heel shorter and I'd be like, \"Nope. With white-out, maybe. Maybe you can do it when I send it into you.\" And the art director was like, \"It's so fun to work with someone who does it the old-fashioned way.\" When I got input back from the kids, it all ended up being worthwhile.\n\n<b>Should we expect more <i>Princess Diaries<\/i> books in the future?<\/b>\n\n<b>MC:<\/b> Yes! There's a <i>From The Notebooks of a Middle School Princess<\/i> sequel that's going to come out next summer, and after that we'll have to see. But hopefully, yes. Maybe when readers get to the end of <i>Royal Wedding<\/i> they'll want to know more about what happens to Mia after. I would love to write a sequel spin-off series with Michael and Mia where they solve crimes in the palace, like <i>Hart to Hart<\/i> with Robert Wagner and Stefanie Powers driving around in their El Romeo in Genovia. I could call it <i>The Royal Murders<\/i>. Also, I really want to do a <i>Princess Diaries<\/i> musical on Broadway. We could take our nieces to a Sunday matinee and have a big showstopper with Grandmère singing about Princess Power or Princess Etiquette.\n\n<b>If you could go back in time and tell your teenage self anything, what would you say?<\/b>\n\n<b>MC:<\/b> \"Don't stress so much, everything's going to be fine.\" My younger self was very, very stressed about my algebra grade — which was an F, by the way — and my dad was a math professor at Indiana University so he was also very stressed over my algebra grade. I know that everyone — especially girls who are not doing so well in STEM — needs to step it up when it comes to math, but I was so convinced I was going to be a failure in life just because of this one grade. I think that everybody needs to know that you can make it up in other ways by being creative or whatever makes you happy.\n\n<b>What would you say to a new writer who doesn't know how to get started?<\/b>\n\n<b>MC:<\/b> Sit down and write. That's 95% of what writing a book is, is just sitting there, getting it done, and putting it all down on paper. The rest is getting out there and trying to get people to look at it. I wish there were some magic words I could say but the truth is, it really is just sitting there and writing it down. And then you have to go back over it, rewrite, and polish it up. And then you have to try your best to get your writing out there and try to get people to look at it.",

                     "description": "John Perry, a prolific author who co-wrote two books with former Arkansas governor and presidential candidate Mike Huckabee and co-wrote one with Alabama Supreme Court Justice Roy Moore, was accused of child molestation in two separate lawsuits, BuzzFeed News has found. \n\nA 2012 police investigation of Perry's alleged offenses found that \"the allegations of sexual battery were sustained\" but that the statute of limitations had expired.\n\nPerry co-wrote <i>Do the Right Thing: Inside the Movement That's Bringing Common Sense Back to America<\/i> about Huckabee's 2008 presidential campaign. He also did research and writing for Huckabee's 2007 book <i>Character Is the Issue<\/i>, a memoir of his early time as governor. Perry also co-wrote <i>So Help Me God,<\/i> Moore's autobiographical account of fighting to keep a monument to the Ten Commandments at Alabama's Supreme Court. \n\nThose books are just a few of the titles produced with Perry's help: He <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/For_Faith_Family.html?id=Eq7dMKYL7HEC\">wrote<\/a> <i>For Faith &amp; Family: Changing America by Strengthening the Family<\/i> with Richard Land, the president of Southern Evangelical Seminary, <a href=\"http://www.bhpublishinggroup.com/products/lifeway-legacy/\">a book with former<\/a> Southern Baptist Convention president James T. Draper, as well as a <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=mAkQe4ZkaDkC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=The+Incredible+Shrinking+Church&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qWsOo-WQry&amp;sig=xFpW3hvpv4LWSY57nZJe7LDUK2s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwCmoVChMI0OHT-_mFxgIVZESMCh3xYQD1#v=snippet&amp;q=%22john%20perry%22&amp;f=false\">book<\/a> with Frank Page, the <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=mAkQe4ZkaDkC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=The+Incredible+Shrinking+Church&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qWsOo-WQry&amp;sig=xFpW3hvpv4LWSY57nZJe7LDUK2s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwCmoVChMI0OHT-_mFxgIVZESMCh3xYQD1#v=snippet&amp;q=%22john%20perry%22&amp;f=false\">president and CEO<\/a> of the Southern Baptist Convention Executive Committee. Perry even co-authored <a href=\"http://www.bhpublishinggroup.com/products/the-vow/\"><i>The Vow<\/i>,<\/a> the book made into a feature film starring Rachel McAdams and Channing Tatum. Perry also <a href=\"http://www.johnsmithperry.com/notable-projects/\">lists writing two books<\/a> for prominent pastor John F. MacArthur on his website. \n\nIn a sworn affidavit submitted during divorce proceedings, Perry's ex-wife attests that she \"filed for divorce as a result of Mr. Perry's inappropriate marital conduct, to which he admitted to in his Response to Interrogatories numbers 1 and 2.\" Throughout the court documents, \"inappropriate marital conduct\" appears to be a euphemism for the alleged molestation. \n\nPerry's responses are not included in the case file.\n\nAnother filing, submitted by Perry's ex-wife's attorney earlier in the same proceedings, refers to Perry's \"admitted sexual abuse\" of a minor child. Perry's response to that filing — also submitted prior to his ex-wife's affidavit — does not deny the abuse, or that Perry admitted it. Instead, Perry claims that \"there was never any testimony or other evidence of any kind presented\" to the court, \"or any orders or findings of fact [...] regarding any alleged sexual abuse of any minor child relative to the parties' divorce or any other legal proceeding.\" \n\nThis claim is not, however, necessarily incompatible with Perry's ex-wife's claim that Perry \"admitted to\" the alleged \"inappropriate marital conduct\" during the discovery process, because it appears that those findings were not technically \"presented\" to the court.\n\nLikewise, a police investigation launched in 2012 found the allegations against Perry \"were sustained,\" according to a police department spokesperson, but that statute of limitations had passed. \n\n\"The alleged sexual battery was reported to have occurred when the victim was between the ages of 11 and 14,\" said Nashville police department spokesperson Don Aaron in a statement to BuzzFeed News.\n\n\"As a result of the investigation, the allegations of sexual battery were sustained, but it was determined that the statute of limitations had tolled, barring prosecution. The victim was age 18 when she first disclosed the allegations to non-law enforcement and said at that time she did not want the matter reported to the Tennessee Department of Children's Services or the police.\"\n\nIn a second series of lawsuits brought in a county court in Tennessee, and related to the same alleged acts of child molestation, Austin Davis, a former parishioner of Covenant Presbyterian Church in Nashville, claims that the church covered up Perry's alleged acts of child molestation and launched a campaign to silence and harass Davis. \n\nInquiries to Covenant Presbyterian were forwarded to their attorney. Autumn Gentry, a lawyer for Covenant Presbyterian, told BuzzFeed News they can't comment on ongoing litigation. \n\nThe individual Perry allegedly molested told BuzzFeed News that she believed that the church reacted appropriately, and did not cover up Perry's alleged offense. Perry has not returned multiple requests for comment from BuzzFeed News.\n\nIn an affidavit submitted as part of his case, Austin Davis claims the accuser told him that she had been molested between the ages of 11 and 13. \n\nIn Davis's court case, he presents what he alleges are minutes from Covenant Presbyterian Church meetings that show Perry resigning from the church's diaconate in 2008, and minutes from 2010 showing Perry was excommunicated from the church because he \"has confessed to committing heinous and repetitive sin [...] and has not shown evidence of repentance.\" The minutes appear to have been introduced as evidence in one of Davis' lawsuits against the church. The church does not appear to have objected to the introduction of the minutes or contested their authenticity.\n\nBuzzFeed News spoke to a longtime church member, who said he had obtained the minutes for Davis and vouched for their authenticity. The minutes are accessible to any church member. The individual Perry allegedly molested also told BuzzFeed News that Perry was excommunicated from the church as a consequence of the alleged abuse. \n\nCatherine Davis, the wife of Austin Davis, likewise wrote in a sworn affidavit that during the summer of 2012, she spoke to the accuser, who confirmed the abuse occurred numerous times when the individual was a minor. Davis said the accuser told her that she broke her silence in 2007 and began telling friends, family members, church leaders, and school officials about what had allegedly occurred.\n\nSpokespeople for Huckabee did not return a request for comment.",

Salinger, written several years before the first publication of <i>Catcher in the Rye<\/i>. Three of these stories later appeared elsewhere; another, \"The Ocean Full of Bowling Balls,\" surprised everyone by surfacing online in 2013. But the remaining two&mdash;\"The Last and Best of the Peter Pans,\" and \"The Magic Foxhole\"&mdash;have never made it out. The latter, a surreal fictionalization of Salinger&#39;s experience storming the beach on D-Day, is said to be one of his favorite pieces of writing.<\/p>\n\n<p>The six manuscripts can&#39;t be checked out. They can only be read by qualified University patrons, under supervision by the Princeton librarians. No recording devices or writing implements are permitted in the reading room. And Salinger&#39;s will states they can&#39;t legally be published until the year 2060. Still, someone&#39;s gotten access to this folder before, and leaking a copy of either of the two remaining unpublished stories to the internet would be one of the greatest capers in the history of piracy.<\/p>\n\n\n <p><small>MANDEL NGAN / Getty Images<\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t<h1>Godspeed You!

Salinger, written several years before the first publication of <i>Catcher in the Rye<\/i>. Three of these stories later appeared elsewhere; another, \"The Ocean Full of Bowling Balls,\" surprised everyone by surfacing online in 2013. But the remaining two—\"The Last and Best of the Peter Pans,\" and \"The Magic Foxhole\"—have never made it out. The latter, a surreal fictionalization of Salinger's experience storming the beach on D-Day, is said to be one of his favorite pieces of writing.\n\nThe six manuscripts can't be checked out. They can only be read by qualified University patrons, under supervision by the Princeton librarians. No recording devices or writing implements are permitted in the reading room. And Salinger's will states they can't legally be published until the year 2060. Still, someone's gotten access to this folder before, and leaking a copy of either of the two remaining unpublished stories to the internet would be one of the greatest capers in the history of piracy.",

Working with a staff of more than 50, it took Myrvhold more than five years to complete the book. But from the moment of its conception Modernist Cuisine was a target for the pirates, and in 2012, on the underground torrent site what.cd, a user named \"buffguy\" uploaded a complete PDF copy. Included with the post was a note, detailing the 200 hours it had taken to scan, edit and organize all two thousand plus pages. Soon, the pirated version Modernist Cuisine was posted to numerous other torrent sites, including a dedicated cookbook piracy concern called deli.sh.\n\nBut the rip of Modernist Cuisine wasn't just about food. For years, the pirates had been fighting a guerilla battle against the intellectual property enforcers, and Myrvhold was a tempting target: in addition to his work as a chef, he is also the founder of Intellectual Ventures, a business which buys up underused patent portfolios then shakes down large corporations by threatening infringement lawsuits on their behalf. (Myrvhold claims this unpopular \"patent-trolling\" spurs innovation; he's even argued that gastronomy would advance more quickly if chefs were permitted to copyright their recipes.) \n\nRight or wrong, the boundaries of intellectual property remain bitterly contested, and, with further editions of Modernist Cuisine in the works, Myrvhold can expect his work to be pirated again.",

                     "description": "<b>Pirated?<\/b> Yes.\n\nIn his unforgettable short story \"Pierre Menard, the Author of Don Quixote,\" the Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges wrote of a recently-deceased novelist named Pierre Menard, who, by immersing himself in the culture and language of medieval Spain, somehow managed to re-write Don Quixote from scratch without referring to the primary text. Menard's Quixote was identical to Cervantes'—\"word for word and line for line\"—but represented, in the author's estimation, an entirely original work.\n\nBorges was obsessed with such questions of authenticity and translation, and when he began translating his own work into English in the late 1960s, he took a similarly unusual approach: in daily sessions with Norman Thomas di Giovanni, a graduate student at Harvard University, Borges re-wrote his own work from scratch. As the two explained in the preface to the 1971 collection The Aleph and Other Stories: \n\n\"We do not consider English and Spanish as compounded sets of easily interchangeable synonyms… English, for example, is far more physical than Spanish. We have therefore shunned the dictionary as much as possible and done our best to rethink every sentence in English words.\"\n\nLike Menard's Quixote, these \"translations\" were in fact unique literary re-imaginings. But, after Borges' died in 1986, his widow rescinded the copyrights for these works. Seeking to recoup the 50% share of licensing revenue that di Giovanni earned from the burgeoning English-language market for Borges, la viuda cut herself a more favorable deal with a different translator, and gradually di Giovanni's wonderful \"physical\" translations fell out of print. \n\nBy the start of the 21st century, literary scholars were discussing Borges alongside Kafka, Beckett and Proust, and Di Giovanni first editions were selling for thousands of dollars. Online, a loose confederation of comp-lit Internet pirates started tracking them down one by one. In 2013, after spending years sourcing and scanning the books, a user by the name of \"dontsurf\" uploaded the complete di Giovanni translations to the private torrent tracker what.cd—a Menard-like masterwork of copyright infringement that would surely have impressed even the Argentine himself.",

Marclay then logged the exact times shown in the clips, and, over the next three years, stitched these images into a 24-hour movie that was itself a meta-clock that told perfect time.

But in 2011, a copy of the artwork sold for nearly half a million dollars, and who has that kind of money? Recently, members of the underground torrent site Pass the Popcorn proposed an alternative approach: if The Clock can't easily be pirated, perhaps it can be remade. By crowdsourcing a list of every single one of The Clock's reference materials, then sourcing that footage from already pirated material, it might be possible to create an identical version of The Clock without ever having access to the original. \n\nThe project remains ongoing.",

The rap collective is seeking a seven-figure price for the album, and has contracted the online auction house Paddle8 to manage the sale. The buyer will receive the only existing physical pressing of Once Upon a Time in Shaolin: two CDs, cased in a hand-carved silver box, further nested inside a velvet-lined cedar box, bound in leather. \n\nThe buyer is most likely to be a man, under 40, with a lot of disposable income and an emotional investment in the Wu-Tang myth—perhaps a tech billionaire, or a Qatari prince. Once the deal closes, he is free to do whatever he wishes with the discs. He can hoard them forever; he can release the tracks one by one over a period of years; he can upload them all to Soundcloud at once. \"We've received several interesting, legitimate offers over the past few months,\" says Paddle8's Sarah Goulet, \"Including one particularly interesting bid. I think you could see a sale sometime in the three or four weeks.\"\n\nSo who is he? Will he leak it?\n\n\"I can't get into specifics,\" says Goulet.\n\nWill the buyer at least identify himself after the sale?\n\n\"Maybe. The other collectors, from day one, never wanted to be identified. But this particular buyer, possibly. It could be an interesting conversation.\"\n\nSean Parker?\n\n\"No. And that's your last guess.\"",

I really liked the part where Elizabeth and her aunt and uncle went on a road trip, which reminded me of Chaucer&#39;s <i>Canterbury Tales<\/i> (also about a road trip &mdash; check it out&#33;). Anyway, good job. I do have a couple of notes to share, in the spirit of constructive criticism. <\/p>\n\n<p>So, a big question I have is \"Why?\" Why does Elizabeth do the things she does? Why does Mr. Darcy do the things he does? Why does Mrs. Bennet do the things she does? Have you read <i>Hamlet<\/i>? I feel like you could really learn something from how Shakespeare (the author) has Hamlet <i>tell<\/i> readers why he&#39;s doing the things he does. <\/p>\n\n<p>Another problem I noticed: Mr. Wickham (great name, by the way, evoking both a strong but flexible plant, and an earthly, bestial pig) is in the army, but you don&#39;t make use of that. What if Mr. Wickham, instead of just being sort of a scoundrel (Again: why?), is a scoundrel because he&#39;s suffering from his experiences in the war? (Which war, btw?) That way he could tell Elizabeth about it, and we would be able to see that she&#39;s not just an independent young woman, but also a really good listener. He could tell some jokes, too, to liven up the mood, and show that Elizabeth has a good sense of humor. This could be the middle section of the book, like five or six chapters in there. <\/p>\n\n<p>Also, why five sisters? How about just two? Combine Jane and Kitty. Or, better, make one of the sisters a brother (named \"Jim,\" maybe?), and then he could be the narrator who mentions his sisters from time to time&#33; Like Hamlet&#33; <\/p>\n\n<p>While I&#39;m on the sisters, is it just me, or does everyone treat Kitty really badly? Personally, I want to say \"Huzzah&#33;\" to Kitty, and it&#39;s annoying that everyone else &mdash; literally everyone else &mdash; wants to hold her back. Even you, I think&mdash; and, sorry, don&#39;t mean to hit too close to home here, but&hellip; I&#39;m just saying that I would totally court Kitty. She&#39;s got a great sense of humor. But anyway, if you change her to Jim, problem solved&#33; <\/p>\n\n<p>A few other concerns: Mrs. Bennett is annoying, and you don&#39;t have any people of color. Also, there aren&#39;t a lot of men in this book. Only about the same number as there are women. I was thinking that what you could do is have Mrs. Bennett be dying, but give her a black best friend. Like Othello? (Have you read it? It&#39;s also by Shakespeare, fwiw.) The Othello character could be her butler, maybe? There you go: three problems solved. You&#39;re welcome&#33;<\/p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t know if you noticed this, but there&#39;s a lot about hair ribbons here. Did you mean to do that? Maybe you could develop them into a kind of motif throughout, the way Shakespeare uses a skull in <i>Hamlet<\/i>? Maybe, when Mrs. Bennet is dying, she could ask to hold a hair ribbon? And Othello the butler could bring it to her, and tell her a story, or, better yet, get Wickham in there to tell her about the war. Oh&#33; Perfect: just have Wickham, Jim and Othello talk about the war, while Mrs. Bennet lies unconscious in the background, holding a ribbon. <\/p>\n\n<p>What do you think about <i>Jim, Othello, and Wickham: Brothers in Arms<\/i> as a title instead of <i>Pride and Prejudice<\/i>? <\/p>\n\n<p>Anyway, while this isn&#39;t something I would pick up on my own to read, I still enjoyed it more than I thought I would. Thanks for letting me take a look, and let me know if you need any more help with it. <\/p>\n\n<p>Keep writing&#33;<br />\nTim<\/p>\n\n\n <p><small><\/small><\/p>",

Herrera was the poet laureate of California from 2012 to 2015.<\/p><p>&ldquo;I feel like I&rsquo;m on one of those big diving boards,&rdquo; he told the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/10/books/juan-felipe-herrera-of-california-to-be-next-poet-laureate.html\"><i>New York Times<\/i><\/a>. &ldquo;I was on a really high one already, and now I&rsquo;m going to the highest one. It&rsquo;s a little scary but I&rsquo;m going to do a back flip and dance as I go into it.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Immigration is a common theme in Herrera&rsquo;s poetry, which includes his collection &ldquo;Border-Crosser With a Lamborghini Dream,&rdquo; and &ldquo;187 Reasons Mexicanos Can&rsquo;t Cross the Border.&rdquo;<\/p><p>In addition to his collections of poetry &ndash; <a href=\"http://www.uapress.arizona.edu/Books/bid1944.htm\">&ldquo;Half the World in Light: New and Selected Poems&rdquo;<\/a> won the National Book Critics Circle Award and the International Latino Book Award &ndash; Herrera is a celebrated young adult and children&rsquo;s book author.<\/p><p>&ldquo;His poems engage in a serious sense of play &ndash; in language and in image &ndash; that I feel gives them enduring power,&rdquo; Librarian of Congress James H. Billington said in a statement, calling Herrera a &ldquo;an American original. &rdquo;I see how they champion vices, traditions and histories, as well as cultural perspective, which is a vital part of our larger American identity.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Herrera was born in California in 1948 as the son of migrant farm workers. He moved around a lot as a child, living in tents and trailers. He graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1972 with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in social anthropology. He received his master&rsquo;s degree from Stanford University and in 1990 received a Masters of Fine Arts at the University of Iowa Writers&rsquo; Workshop.<\/p><p>He retired as professor at the University of California, Riverside, this year and is currently a visiting professor at the University of Washington, Seattle.<\/p><p>&ldquo;I write while I&rsquo;m walking, on little scraps of paper,&rdquo; he told the <i>Times<\/i>. &ldquo;If I have a melody going, I can feel it for days.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Other poets to have held the position include Natasha Trethewey, Phillip Levine, Kay Ryan, Charles Simic, Donald Hall, Billy Collins and Rita Dove.<\/p><h1>Here are a few of Herrera&#39;s poems:<\/h1><p><b>19 Pokrovskaya Street<\/b><\/p><p>My father lights the kerosene lamp, his beard bitten, hands<\/p><p>wet from the river, where he kneels to pray in the mornings,<\/p><p>he sits and pulls out his razor, rummages through a gunnysack,<\/p><p>papers, photos of his children in another country, he cries a little<\/p><p>when he mentions his mother, Benita, and his father, Salom&eacute;,<\/p><p>who ran a stable in El Mulato, Chihuahua, eyes cast down<\/p><p>then he points to the mural on the wall, the red<\/p><p>angels descending to earth, naked mothers with bellies giving birth,<\/p><p>lovers in wrinkled green trousers, and a horse with the figures<\/p><p>of children laughing on its back, a goat floats across the night,<\/p><p>a flank of tawdry farmers unfurl into a sparkling forest moon<\/p><p>where elegant birds sit on snowy branches, here is<\/p><p>a miniature virgin where the yellow flames light up the village<\/p><p>one dancer carries fishing poles and easels with diamonds<\/p><p>and other jewels as colors, my father is silent<\/p><p>when he sees these things cut across my face.<\/p>\n\n<p>Excerpted from Half of the World in Light: New and Selected Poems by Juan Felipe Herrera.<\/p><p>Copyright &copy;2008 Juan Felipe Herrera.
