There is no biological connection to [Griner] and the unborn child.\"\n\nThe couple was married on May 8, two weeks after they were both arrested on charges of assault and domestic violence. \n\nOn May 15, one week after their wedding, the WNBA announced it had suspended Griner and Johnson for seven games each. \n\nIn a statement, WNBA President Laurel J. Richie explained the suspension:\n\n<blockquote>The WNBA immediately initiated its own investigation into the incident. It was extremely important for us to review the events thoroughly and carefully. Over the course of three weeks, the league conducted interviews with both players and three witnesses present for much of the altercation, and reviewed the police report, medical records, photos and other materials in order to determine the facts. Based on the WNBA's investigation, the following summary of facts is largely undisputed. \n\nBrittney and Glory were involved in a physical altercation with each other at their home. It began when Glory pushed Brittney in the shoulder and Brittney pushed Glory in the back of the neck. The confrontation escalated to include wrestling, punches, and the throwing and swinging of various objects. Brittney received a bite wound on her finger and scratches on her wrist, and Glory received a scratch above her lip and was diagnosed with a concussion.\n\nOn April 28, Brittney pleaded guilty in Goodyear City Court to misdemeanor disorderly conduct and entered a diversion program. The assault charge was dismissed. Brittney is required to complete a 26-week domestic violence course, and if she successfully completes the course (and meets other standard conditions), the disorderly conduct charge will be dismissed. Glory's case was transferred to county court and is still pending.<\/blockquote>",

The New York Jets cornerback was dressed more for a social event or fashion shoot &mdash; in a sharply tailored navy suit, diamond cuff links, and a shirt with his initials embroidered on the small strip of sleeve his jacket left exposed &mdash; but instead, he was standing among bike seats, skateboards, and kayaks in the rear corner of a Sports Authority in Mount Laurel, New Jersey, a sleepy Philly suburb.<br /><br />&ldquo;You&rsquo;re talking <i>way<\/i> too fast and saying too much,&rdquo; Annie Goodrich gently admonished the 6-foot-2-inch, four-time Pro Bowl pick credited with the league&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/videos/san-diego-chargers/0ap2000000147584/Antonio-Cromartie-109-yard-field-goal-return\">longest touchdown run<\/a>.<br /><br />Goodrich and her husband, Bob, run a media and broadcast training company for professional athletes. It&rsquo;s all part of the NFL&rsquo;s Broadcast Bootcamp, in its ninth year, which trains players for possible future careers in radio, television, and game-calling. After the three-day annual course, players leave with a short reel and an understanding of the broadcast industry. Network talent managers have also started using the program as a scouting resource, and NFL&rsquo;s Player Engagement Manager Samantha Kleinman described it to BuzzFeed News it as &ldquo;the Combine, but for broadcasting.&rdquo;<br /><br />On Wednesday morning, Cromartie interviewed his teammate Leger Douzable, a defensive end, about his prediction for this year&rsquo;s biggest fantasy football player. Unable to settle on one, Cromartie named Aaron Rodgers for his consistency and Adrian Peterson because &ldquo;he&rsquo;s had a year off&rdquo;; after facing child abuse charges, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s ready to play.&rdquo; They were were given the option to ask five different questions for the exercise &mdash; they read the script from a Teleprompter &mdash; and were allowed to write their own if they felt none of the questions allowed for them to think quickly while on camera.<br /><br />While waiting for their turn to rehearse, Douzable and Cromartie freely and casually conversed about the game and the revamped Buffalo Bills, their division rivals. Cromartie had no shortage of carefully considered opinions on fellow cornerback Richard Sherman, who he&rsquo;d <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/12998969/antonio-cromartie-new-york-jets-richard-sherman-seattle-seahawks-not-top-cornerbacks-nfl\">taken to task<\/a> the day prior while on a Sirius radio program. It was that easy banter that Goodrich tried to capture for the exercises, where each person spent three 90-second segments as interviewer and interviewee.<br /><br />Show &ldquo;more energy and personality,&rdquo; Goodrich told the duo after their first run-through.<br /><br />&ldquo;You wandered off your spot,&rdquo; she told Cromartie after another. He agreed, and looked at the duct tape indicators on the floor knowingly.<br /><br />&ldquo;So much feedback,&rdquo; Cromartie told BuzzFeed News, wide-eyed.<br /><br />Cromartie said he enjoys the constructive criticism. As a veteran interviewee after games, he is polished and provides concise, straightforward answers. That will, eventually, translate easily to an interviewer or analyst role.<br /><br />But he&rsquo;s not there yet. This is where the football-driven work ethics of Douzable and Cromartie came in handy: After each attempt, they picked up the microphone and ran the route again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-06/5/11/enhanced/webdr06/enhanced-mid-21077-1433519977-1.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" alt=\"\" /><\/p>\n \n\t<p>Cromartie<\/p>\n\n\n <p><small>Lindsey Adler/BuzzFeed News<\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><br /><\/p><p>Cromartie is approaching his 10th season in the NFL, and admits he has to think about his life after the full-contact sport. &ldquo;You never know when that play will come,&rdquo; he said. He was referring to a hit that could end his career without notice. He said he &ldquo;absolutely&rdquo; intends to pursue broadcasting after his player career is over.<br /><br />The NFL Player&rsquo;s Association claims the <a href=\"http://www.statista.com/statistics/240102/average-player-career-length-in-the-national-football-league/\">average<\/a> NFL career is &ldquo;about 3.3 years.&rdquo; For &ldquo;players with at least one Pro Bowl appearance,&rdquo; which includes Cromartie, the average is estimated at 11.7 years.<br /><br />Dazzling careers can end with a single hit &mdash; think Steve Young &mdash; and the effects of years of repetitive brain trauma can make it difficult for a player to maintain a comfortable lifestyle after their career.<br /><br />The money players are contracted to make is hardly indicative of how much they will be left with when they no longer suit up for games. Contracts are not guaranteed, and agents&#39; fees and taxes can drain up to 50% of a contract earning. Ill-advised investments, legal troubles, and learning to curb spending when the big paychecks stop are issues in retirement.<br /><br />An April 2015 <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/04/15/nfl-players-bankrupt/\">report<\/a> by the National Bureau of Economic Research said 15.7% of former NFL players have filed bankruptcy within 12 years of leaving the league. Kleinman told BuzzFeed News that &ldquo;broadcasting is one of the few career paths with an earnings potential&rdquo; anywhere near what players make in the NFL.<br /><br />Kleinman argues that the Player Engagement program is not a direct response to the statistics about former player bankruptcy. The initiative has existed since 1991, long before the issue came into the spotlight and received widespread media attention.<br /><br />Cromartie insists that money isn&rsquo;t a factor when considering life after the league.<br /><br />In 2010, he took a <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2010/03/08/jets-front-cromartie-500000-to-clear-up-paternity-issues/\">salary advance<\/a> from the Jets to resolve paternity and child support payments for his reportedly seven children in five different states. At that point in his career, he&rsquo;d made less than $1 million, but now his projected career <a href=\"http://www.spotrac.com/nfl/new-york-jets/antonio-cromartie/cash-earnings/\">earnings<\/a> have increased to nearly $37 million through the 2014&ndash;2015 season.<br /><br />Today Cromartie has ten children from eight women, one of whom has been his wife since 2010. When asked if child support payments for the children not in his custody present a significant financial expense, Cromartie issued a stern &ldquo;no.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about passion,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same as with football: If you&rsquo;re only in it for a check, you&rsquo;re not gonna last very long.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-06/5/12/enhanced/webdr12/enhanced-mid-1412-1433520002-1.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" alt=\"\" /><\/p>\n \n\t<p>Jaworski (left) at the boot camp.<\/p>\n\n\n <p><small>Lindsey Adler/BuzzFeed News<\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><br /><\/p><p>During Broadcast Bootcamp, players report for breakfast at their hotel at 6:30 a.m., then spend the day at the NFL Films campus, based in Mount Laurel, until 6 p.m. or 8 p.m., depending on the day&rsquo;s programming. For most people who aren&rsquo;t professional athletes, whose lives are defined &mdash; not interrupted &mdash; by long, intense workdays, the rigorous schedule would be rough.<br /><br />The boot camp is part of the NFL Player Engagement department, which offers classes in continuing education, personal finances, counseling, and transitions to and careers for post-NFL life &mdash; players learn about franchising businesses, coaching, or broadcast, for example. Participation is optional, but Kleinman told BuzzFeed News that &ldquo;nearly 15%&rdquo; of players enroll.<br /><br />For the broadcast classes, players are split into groups and are shuffled around from one hourlong session to the next. Classes like &ldquo;your studio voice,&rdquo; writing for Teleprompters, on-site broadcast rehearsal, tape study, game calling, and others are all crammed into the boot camp.<br /><br />Ike Taylor, a cornerback who retired from the league in April after 12 seasons with the Steelers, joined Douzable and Cromartie this year.<br /><br />Group photos of Bootcamp alumni run across a wall in NFL Films&rsquo; far wing. Few faces are recognizable.

The New York Jets cornerback was dressed more for a social event or fashion shoot &mdash; in a sharply tailored navy suit, diamond cuff links, and a shirt with his initials embroidered on the small strip of sleeve his jacket left exposed &mdash; but instead, he was standing among bike seats, skateboards, and kayaks in the rear corner of a Sports Authority in Mount Laurel, New Jersey, a sleepy Philly suburb.<br /><br />&ldquo;You&rsquo;re talking <i>way<\/i> too fast and saying too much,&rdquo; Annie Goodrich gently admonished the 6-foot-2-inch, four-time Pro Bowl pick credited with the league&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.nfl.com/videos/san-diego-chargers/0ap2000000147584/Antonio-Cromartie-109-yard-field-goal-return\">longest touchdown run<\/a>.<br /><br />Goodrich and her husband, Bob, run a media and broadcast training company for professional athletes. It&rsquo;s all part of the NFL&rsquo;s Broadcast Bootcamp, in its ninth year, which trains players for possible future careers in radio, television, and game-calling. After the three-day annual course, players leave with a short reel and an understanding of the broadcast industry. Network talent managers have also started using the program as a scouting resource, and NFL&rsquo;s Player Engagement Manager Samantha Kleinman described it to BuzzFeed News it as &ldquo;the Combine, but for broadcasting.&rdquo;<br /><br />On Wednesday morning, Cromartie interviewed his teammate Leger Douzable, a defensive end, about his prediction for this year&rsquo;s biggest fantasy football player. Unable to settle on one, Cromartie named Aaron Rodgers for his consistency and Adrian Peterson because &ldquo;he&rsquo;s had a year off&rdquo;; after facing child abuse charges, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s ready to play.&rdquo; They were were given the option to ask five different questions for the exercise &mdash; they read the script from a Teleprompter &mdash; and were allowed to write their own if they felt none of the questions allowed for them to think quickly while on camera.<br /><br />While waiting for their turn to rehearse, Douzable and Cromartie freely and casually conversed about the game and the revamped Buffalo Bills, their division rivals. Cromartie had no shortage of carefully considered opinions on fellow cornerback Richard Sherman, who he&rsquo;d <a href=\"http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/12998969/antonio-cromartie-new-york-jets-richard-sherman-seattle-seahawks-not-top-cornerbacks-nfl\">taken to task<\/a> the day prior while on a Sirius radio program. It was that easy banter that Goodrich tried to capture for the exercises, where each person spent three 90-second segments as interviewer and interviewee.<br /><br />Show &ldquo;more energy and personality,&rdquo; Goodrich told the duo after their first run-through.<br /><br />&ldquo;You wandered off your spot,&rdquo; she told Cromartie after another. He agreed, and looked at the duct tape indicators on the floor knowingly.<br /><br />&ldquo;So much feedback,&rdquo; Cromartie told BuzzFeed News, wide-eyed.<br /><br />Cromartie said he enjoys the constructive criticism. As a veteran interviewee after games, he is polished and provides concise, straightforward answers. That will, eventually, translate easily to an interviewer or analyst role.<br /><br />But he&rsquo;s not there yet. This is where the football-driven work ethics of Douzable and Cromartie came in handy: After each attempt, they picked up the microphone and ran the route again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-06/5/11/enhanced/webdr06/enhanced-mid-21077-1433519977-1.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" alt=\"\" /><\/p>\n \n\t<p>Cromartie<\/p>\n\n\n <p><small>Lindsey Adler/BuzzFeed News<\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><br /><\/p><p>Cromartie is approaching his 10th season in the NFL, and admits he has to think about his life after the full-contact sport. &ldquo;You never know when that play will come,&rdquo; he said. He was referring to a hit that could end his career without notice. He said he &ldquo;absolutely&rdquo; intends to pursue broadcasting after his player career is over.<br /><br />The NFL Player&rsquo;s Association claims the <a href=\"http://www.statista.com/statistics/240102/average-player-career-length-in-the-national-football-league/\">average<\/a> NFL career is &ldquo;about 3.3 years.&rdquo; For &ldquo;players with at least one Pro Bowl appearance,&rdquo; which includes Cromartie, the average is estimated at 11.7 years.<br /><br />Dazzling careers can end with a single hit &mdash; think Steve Young &mdash; and the effects of years of repetitive brain trauma can make it difficult for a player to maintain a comfortable lifestyle after their career.<br /><br />The money players are contracted to make is hardly indicative of how much they will be left with when they no longer suit up for games. Contracts are not guaranteed, and agents&#39; fees and taxes can drain up to 50% of a contract earning. Ill-advised investments, legal troubles, and learning to curb spending when the big paychecks stop are issues in retirement.<br /><br />An April 2015 <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/04/15/nfl-players-bankrupt/\">report<\/a> by the National Bureau of Economic Research said 15.7% of former NFL players have filed bankruptcy within 12 years of leaving the league. Kleinman told BuzzFeed News that &ldquo;broadcasting is one of the few career paths with an earnings potential&rdquo; anywhere near what players make in the NFL.<br /><br />Kleinman argues that the Player Engagement program is not a direct response to the statistics about former player bankruptcy. The initiative has existed since 1991, long before the issue came into the spotlight and received widespread media attention.<br /><br />Cromartie insists that money isn&rsquo;t a factor when considering life after the league.<br /><br />In 2010, he took a <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2010/03/08/jets-front-cromartie-500000-to-clear-up-paternity-issues/\">salary advance<\/a> from the Jets to resolve paternity and child support payments for his reportedly seven children in five different states. At that point in his career, he&rsquo;d made less than $1 million, but now his projected career <a href=\"http://www.spotrac.com/nfl/new-york-jets/antonio-cromartie/cash-earnings/\">earnings<\/a> have increased to nearly $37 million through the 2014&ndash;2015 season.<br /><br />Today Cromartie has ten children from eight women, one of whom has been his wife since 2010. When asked if child support payments for the children not in his custody present a significant financial expense, Cromartie issued a stern &ldquo;no.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about passion,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same as with football: If you&rsquo;re only in it for a check, you&rsquo;re not gonna last very long.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-06/5/12/enhanced/webdr12/enhanced-mid-1412-1433520002-1.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" alt=\"\" /><\/p>\n \n\t<p>Jaworski (left) at the boot camp.<\/p>\n\n\n <p><small>Lindsey Adler/BuzzFeed News<\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><br /><\/p><p>During Broadcast Bootcamp, players report for breakfast at their hotel at 6:30 a.m., then spend the day at the NFL Films campus, based in Mount Laurel, until 6 p.m. or 8 p.m., depending on the day&rsquo;s programming. For most people who aren&rsquo;t professional athletes, whose lives are defined &mdash; not interrupted &mdash; by long, intense workdays, the rigorous schedule would be rough.<br /><br />The boot camp is part of the NFL Player Engagement department, which offers classes in continuing education, personal finances, counseling, and transitions to and careers for post-NFL life &mdash; players learn about franchising businesses, coaching, or broadcast, for example. Participation is optional, but Kleinman told BuzzFeed News that &ldquo;nearly 15%&rdquo; of players enroll.<br /><br />For the broadcast classes, players are split into groups and are shuffled around from one hourlong session to the next. Classes like &ldquo;your studio voice,&rdquo; writing for Teleprompters, on-site broadcast rehearsal, tape study, game calling, and others are all crammed into the boot camp.<br /><br />Ike Taylor, a cornerback who retired from the league in April after 12 seasons with the Steelers, joined Douzable and Cromartie this year.<br /><br />Group photos of Bootcamp alumni run across a wall in NFL Films&rsquo; far wing. Few faces are recognizable.

Any suggestion by BuzzFeed to the contrary is defamatory and will be brought to the attention of our legal counsel.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>But a source close to Qatar&#39;s 2022 Supreme Committee told BuzzFeed News that its leaders were \"scared about Blatter going because they don&#39;t want the World Cup vote to be reopened.\" He said: \"The entire 2022 bid team have been advised not to travel to the USA. ... They are concerned about being arrested and pulled in for questioning.\" <\/p>\n\n<p>A second source said that Qatari bid officials had been advised by lawyers not to travel to the U.S. \"There is an internal informal advice from the US lawyers working for Q22 to the top officials of Q22 not to go to USA,\" he wrote in an email. <\/p>\n\n<p>Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, the young royal who chaired the country&#39;s successful World Cup bid, is said to be the only senior figure who is exempted from the ban because he is understood to travel under a diplomatic passport that grants him immunity from arrest.<\/p>\n\n<p>Blatter&#39;s bombshell resignation leaves Qatar exposed to mounting calls for the 2022 World Cup to be moved to a new venue in the wake of an avalanche of evidence that the country&#39;s most senior football official, Mohamed bin Hammam, waged a multimillion-dollar vote-buying campaign to rig the ballot in his country&#39;s favour. The official Qatar 2022 bid committee has always vehemently denied any wrongdoing and said he was not working on its behalf. <\/p>\n\n<p>The decision to award the world&#39;s biggest sporting tournament to the tiny desert nation of Qatar was greeted with dismay and derision around the world when it was announced by Blatter following a secret ballot of FIFA voters in 2010. The country had almost no soccer infrastructure, no serious professional league, and its searing summer temperatures of up to 122&ordm;F were judged by FIFA&#39;s own technical assessors to pose a \"high risk\" to the health of players. Allegations that the secret ballot had been rigged by bribery and backroom deals soon began to surface. <\/p>\n\n<p>More than perhaps anyone, Blatter has protected Qatar. Time and again, he has rebuffed calls for the tiny Gulf state to be stripped of the right to host the tournament. Sources say he has shielded Qatar from allegations of corruption since striking a deal with the country&#39;s royal family to protect the 2022 tournament if bin Hammam dropped his challenge for the presidency of FIFA in 2011. <\/p>\n\n<p>\"Blatter had told Qatar that he would expose their bid unless they made bin Hammam pull out,\" a source close to the Qatari billionaire has told me. \"He told me there was a deal and he was forced to withdraw.\"<\/p>\n\n<p>Bin Hammam pulled out on the eve of the election, and Blatter has since repeatedly refused to consider reopening the World Cup vote despite massive and growing evidence that the original ballot in 2010 was skewed by rampant vote-buying. <\/p>\n\n<p>Days after the deal was allegedly struck in 2011, Blatter announced that Qatar was \"not touched\" by corruption allegations, and FIFA would do \"nothing\" about evidence <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/culture-media-sport/Sunday-Times-evidence-09052011.pdf\">passed to a parliamentary inquiry<\/a> by the <i>Sunday Times<\/i> suggesting Qatar had paid massive bribes to FIFA voters to obtain the right to stage the 2022 competition. <\/p>\n\n<p>Then last year, when my colleague Jonathan Calvert and I <a href=\"http://times-fifafiles-prod.elasticbeanstalk.com/\">published evidence<\/a> from a vast trove of leaked documents showing how bin Hammam had used a multimillion-dollar network of slush funds to bribe dozens of officials to support the country&#39;s bid, Blatter took no action against Qatar and instead accused us of \"discrimination and racism\". The story of bin Hammam&#39;s vote-buying campaign and the Qatari deal with Blatter is set out in our new book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Ugly-Game-Qatari-World/dp/147114934X\"><i>The Ugly Game<\/i><\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p>The full lengths to which Blatter was prepared to go to protect Qatar became clear when FIFA suppressed its own internal report on corruption in the 2018 and 2022 bidding race, submitted to its ethics chamber by the former U.S. attorney Michael Garcia last September. <\/p>\n\n<p>Blatter refused to publish the report in full but claimed it had cleared Qatar and Russia of any wrongdoing. However, Garcia promptly <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/davidmack/fifa-ethics-investigator-michael-garcia-resigns-in-protest#.hfevnAZkog\">resigned in a fury<\/a>, saying that FIFA&#39;s summary of his work contained \"numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations of the facts.\" <\/p>\n\n<p>Despite international outrage at the handling of the Garcia report, Blatter appeared at a press conference in December last year to confirm that the 2018 and 2022 World Cups <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/franciswhittaker/fifa-agrees-to-publish-world-cup-corruption-report-findings#.rkrr8Rd0mX\">would not be moved<\/a>. <\/p>\n\n<p>With Blatter at the helm, it appeared that the two tournaments were unassailable. A source close to Garcia <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/heidiblake/fifas-cover-up-of-its-internal-investigation-may-now-lead-to#.btRLw2QjeB\">told BuzzFeed News last week<\/a> that FIFA would never respond properly to the evidence of corruption until Blatter was deposed. \"Nothing&#39;s going to change as long as the current administration is there,\" he said. <\/p>\n\n<p>Blatter was sailing serenely towards re-election for a fifth term at the helm of world soccer until the U.S. Department of Justice last week indicted 14 football officials and marketing executives accused of corrupting the game over two decades in a criminal enterprise involving an alleged $150 million in bribes. Though Blatter himself was not indicted, investigators refused to rule him out of their enquiries. <\/p>\n\n<p>At the same time, Swiss prosecutors announced their own investigation into the decision to award the rights to host the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar, and are understood to be planning to pull Blatter in for questioning. <\/p>\n\n<p>The pressure intensified when the United Kingdom&#39;s Serious Fraud Office announced on Friday that it was actively assessing material related to corruption within FIFA. <\/p>\n\n<p>Despite the firestorm of scandal engulfing world soccer in the wake of the arrests, Blatter refused to stand aside and was re-elected for a fifth term in office last Friday. But his stunning resignation on Tuesday came after his right hand man, the FIFA secretary general J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Valcke, was linked to a $10 million payment from the organisers of the South African World Cup to accounts controlled by a key voter, the longtime FIFA grandee Jack Warner. <\/p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/opa/file/450211/download\">FBI indictment<\/a> cites the $10 million payment as an alleged bribe in exchange for Warner&#39;s vote for the South African bid to host the 2010 World Cup. FIFA <a href=\"http://www.fifa.com/governance/news/y=2015/m=6/news=fifa-statement-on-the-south-african-diaspora-legacy-programme-2617422.html\">initially denied claims<\/a> of Valcke&#39;s involvement, which <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/02/sports/soccer/sepp-blatters-top-fifa-deputy-jerome-valcke-is-said-to-have-transferred-money-central-to-bribery-case.html\">emerged on Tuesday morning<\/a>. But within hours a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/martynziegler/status/605660641374912512\">leaked letter surfaced on Twitter<\/a> apparently showing that the secretary general was told about the payment, which was transferred to Warner via FIFA&#39;s own accounts. <\/p>\n\n<p>The apparent implication of Valcke &mdash; Blatter&#39;s most senior lieutenant &mdash; in the payment of an alleged bribe brings the scandal closer to the door of the president&#39;s office than ever before. <\/p>\n\n<p>Blatter&#39;s departure &mdash; after 17 years at the helm of world soccer &mdash; leaves the fate of Qatar&#39;s 2022 World Cup dream in greater jeopardy than it has ever faced. <\/p>\n\n<p>Qatar&#39;s biggest rivals &mdash; the U.S. and Australia &mdash; are poised to jump straight back into the mix, should a new president decide to take the bold step of ordering a rerun of the vote on the hosting of the world&#39;s biggest sporting tournament.<\/p>\n\n\n <p><small><\/small><\/p>",

                     "description": "The fate of the Qatar 2022 World Cup hangs in the balance after the resignation of its chief protector, FIFA president Sepp Blatter, amid the biggest bribery and corruption investigation in sporting history.\n \nInsiders say the leaders of Qatar's 2022 Supreme Committee (or local organising committee) have now been told not to set foot on U.S. soil for fear of being arrested by the FBI in its investigation into allegations that FIFA officials turned football into a \"criminal enterprise\" and presided over a \"World Cup of fraud.\" \n\nBlatter <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeednews/russian-president-vladimir-putin-accuses-us-officials-of-med#.vqYEgeXZ5Y\">resigned<\/a> in a shock move at an emergency press conference at FIFA headquarters on Tuesday afternoon, days after Swiss authorities, acting at the behest of the FBI, arrested seven senior football officials on the eve of his re-election at world football's annual congress in Zurich last week.\n\nQatar 2022 vehemently denied that its officials have been warned to avoid traveling to the United States. \"Your information is incorrect and running a story based on it is irresponsible,\" wrote spokesperson Nasser Al-Khater. \"Neither the Supreme Committee for Delivery &amp; Legacy nor anyone associated with it or the Qatar bid have any reason to avoid travelling to the United States or anywhere else in the world. Any suggestion by BuzzFeed to the contrary is defamatory and will be brought to the attention of our legal counsel.\"\n\nBut a source close to Qatar's 2022 Supreme Committee told BuzzFeed News that its leaders were \"scared about Blatter going because they don't want the World Cup vote to be reopened.\" He said: \"The entire 2022 bid team have been advised not to travel to the USA. ... They are concerned about being arrested and pulled in for questioning.\" \n\nA second source said that Qatari bid officials had been advised by lawyers not to travel to the U.S. \"There is an internal informal advice from the US lawyers working for Q22 to the top officials of Q22 not to go to USA,\" he wrote in an email. \n\nSheikh Mohammed bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, the young royal who chaired the country's successful World Cup bid, is said to be the only senior figure who is exempted from the ban because he is understood to travel under a diplomatic passport that grants him immunity from arrest.\n\nBlatter's bombshell resignation leaves Qatar exposed to mounting calls for the 2022 World Cup to be moved to a new venue in the wake of an avalanche of evidence that the country's most senior football official, Mohamed bin Hammam, waged a multimillion-dollar vote-buying campaign to rig the ballot in his country's favour. The official Qatar 2022 bid committee has always vehemently denied any wrongdoing and said he was not working on its behalf. \n\nThe decision to award the world's biggest sporting tournament to the tiny desert nation of Qatar was greeted with dismay and derision around the world when it was announced by Blatter following a secret ballot of FIFA voters in 2010. The country had almost no soccer infrastructure, no serious professional league, and its searing summer temperatures of up to 122ºF were judged by FIFA's own technical assessors to pose a \"high risk\" to the health of players. Allegations that the secret ballot had been rigged by bribery and backroom deals soon began to surface. \n\nMore than perhaps anyone, Blatter has protected Qatar. Time and again, he has rebuffed calls for the tiny Gulf state to be stripped of the right to host the tournament. Sources say he has shielded Qatar from allegations of corruption since striking a deal with the country's royal family to protect the 2022 tournament if bin Hammam dropped his challenge for the presidency of FIFA in 2011. \n\n\"Blatter had told Qatar that he would expose their bid unless they made bin Hammam pull out,\" a source close to the Qatari billionaire has told me. \"He told me there was a deal and he was forced to withdraw.\"\n\nBin Hammam pulled out on the eve of the election, and Blatter has since repeatedly refused to consider reopening the World Cup vote despite massive and growing evidence that the original ballot in 2010 was skewed by rampant vote-buying. \n\nDays after the deal was allegedly struck in 2011, Blatter announced that Qatar was \"not touched\" by corruption allegations, and FIFA would do \"nothing\" about evidence <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/culture-media-sport/Sunday-Times-evidence-09052011.pdf\">passed to a parliamentary inquiry<\/a> by the <i>Sunday Times<\/i> suggesting Qatar had paid massive bribes to FIFA voters to obtain the right to stage the 2022 competition. \n\nThen last year, when my colleague Jonathan Calvert and I <a href=\"http://times-fifafiles-prod.elasticbeanstalk.com/\">published evidence<\/a> from a vast trove of leaked documents showing how bin Hammam had used a multimillion-dollar network of slush funds to bribe dozens of officials to support the country's bid, Blatter took no action against Qatar and instead accused us of \"discrimination and racism\". The story of bin Hammam's vote-buying campaign and the Qatari deal with Blatter is set out in our new book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Ugly-Game-Qatari-World/dp/147114934X\"><i>The Ugly Game<\/i><\/a>. \n\nThe full lengths to which Blatter was prepared to go to protect Qatar became clear when FIFA suppressed its own internal report on corruption in the 2018 and 2022 bidding race, submitted to its ethics chamber by the former U.S. attorney Michael Garcia last September. \n\nBlatter refused to publish the report in full but claimed it had cleared Qatar and Russia of any wrongdoing. However, Garcia promptly <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/davidmack/fifa-ethics-investigator-michael-garcia-resigns-in-protest#.hfevnAZkog\">resigned in a fury<\/a>, saying that FIFA's summary of his work contained \"numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations of the facts.\" \n\nDespite international outrage at the handling of the Garcia report, Blatter appeared at a press conference in December last year to confirm that the 2018 and 2022 World Cups <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/franciswhittaker/fifa-agrees-to-publish-world-cup-corruption-report-findings#.rkrr8Rd0mX\">would not be moved<\/a>. \n\nWith Blatter at the helm, it appeared that the two tournaments were unassailable. A source close to Garcia <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/heidiblake/fifas-cover-up-of-its-internal-investigation-may-now-lead-to#.btRLw2QjeB\">told BuzzFeed News last week<\/a> that FIFA would never respond properly to the evidence of corruption until Blatter was deposed. \"Nothing's going to change as long as the current administration is there,\" he said. \n\nBlatter was sailing serenely towards re-election for a fifth term at the helm of world soccer until the U.S. Department of Justice last week indicted 14 football officials and marketing executives accused of corrupting the game over two decades in a criminal enterprise involving an alleged $150 million in bribes. Though Blatter himself was not indicted, investigators refused to rule him out of their enquiries. \n\nAt the same time, Swiss prosecutors announced their own investigation into the decision to award the rights to host the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar, and are understood to be planning to pull Blatter in for questioning. \n\nThe pressure intensified when the United Kingdom's Serious Fraud Office announced on Friday that it was actively assessing material related to corruption within FIFA. \n\nDespite the firestorm of scandal engulfing world soccer in the wake of the arrests, Blatter refused to stand aside and was re-elected for a fifth term in office last Friday. But his stunning resignation on Tuesday came after his right hand man, the FIFA secretary general Jérôme Valcke, was linked to a $10 million payment from the organisers of the South African World Cup to accounts controlled by a key voter, the longtime FIFA grandee Jack Warner. \n\nThe <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/opa/file/450211/download\">FBI indictment<\/a> cites the $10 million payment as an alleged bribe in exchange for Warner's vote for the South African bid to host the 2010 World Cup. FIFA <a href=\"http://www.fifa.com/governance/news/y=2015/m=6/news=fifa-statement-on-the-south-african-diaspora-legacy-programme-2617422.html\">initially denied claims<\/a> of Valcke's involvement, which <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/02/sports/soccer/sepp-blatters-top-fifa-deputy-jerome-valcke-is-said-to-have-transferred-money-central-to-bribery-case.html\">emerged on Tuesday morning<\/a>. But within hours a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/martynziegler/status/605660641374912512\">leaked letter surfaced on Twitter<\/a> apparently showing that the secretary general was told about the payment, which was transferred to Warner via FIFA's own accounts. \n\nThe apparent implication of Valcke — Blatter's most senior lieutenant — in the payment of an alleged bribe brings the scandal closer to the door of the president's office than ever before. \n\nBlatter's departure — after 17 years at the helm of world soccer — leaves the fate of Qatar's 2022 World Cup dream in greater jeopardy than it has ever faced. \n\nQatar's biggest rivals — the U.S. and Australia — are poised to jump straight back into the mix, should a new president decide to take the bold step of ordering a rerun of the vote on the hosting of the world's biggest sporting tournament.",
