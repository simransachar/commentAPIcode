I am officially a Kylie Kouture Konvert.\"\n\n<b>Rachel:<\/b> \"At first I would have said yes... but then I recently found really great 14-inch clip-ins at a Brooklyn hair and beauty store for $60 (!!), and there were <i>tons<\/i> of other options that were way more competitively priced. (Even Bellami sells other 20-inch extensions that are considerably cheaper.) The ones I bought aren't <i>quite<\/i> as luscious as the Kylie ones, but they are pretty legit and don't come with a ton of extra wefts that we ultimately realized you don't really need. So...while they are fabulous, they are not worth $250.\"",
