Mone / AP<\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Surrounded by expensive homes and a lush green park, the pool in Craig Ranch, McKinney, has long functioned as a focal point for its community. Residents call the Dallas-area city an idyllic Texan town, and streets in the planned estate are referred to as &ldquo;trails,&rdquo; with names like Lonesome Spur, White Stallion, and Desert Dunes conjuring up images of the Old West. On hot summer days, parents and kids stroll from nearby designer brick homes to relax and cool off in the pool, which residents need a card to use. Sometimes the pool hosts movie nights, handing out popcorn as swimmers watch films on a large inflatable screen.<br /><\/p><p>&ldquo;I love our neighborhood,&rdquo; Craig Ranch resident Shannon Barber Toon, who has lived in McKinney for four years, told BuzzFeed News. &ldquo;I love that I can walk my kids to the pool. We have friends of all races. You can always come out and find people to talk to.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Barber Toon went to the pool Friday night with her husband, Sean Toon, their two children, and her two female friends. Later that evening, though, the pool would become the latest flash point for America&rsquo;s ongoing debate over race relations and police brutality. Sean Toon has claimed in multiple media interviews that the media has misrepresented the events, but Toon himself has failed to tell the full story.<\/p><p>Tension broke out at the pool after dozens of mostly black teenagers had arrived for an end-of-school party that grew well beyond its planned size. There was a professional DJ playing music, but no tickets were sold and the organizers didn&#39;t throw the party for profit, teens told BuzzFeed News. They also vehemently denied reports that some were using drugs or alcohol. Many kids had cards to the pool and others were using shared guest passes to gain entry, but when pool attendants stopped letting people in some began jumping the fence.<\/p><p>Soon, the Toons and others called police. Teens fled, and one officer began frantically rounding up anyone he could. In video of the ensuing scenes, Cpl. Eric Casebolt is seen frantically barrel-rolling into frame, before ordering mostly black teens on to the ground, while their white classmates are left to stand by and film the events. After she and her friends were ordered by Casebolt to leave, Dajerria Becton, a black teen wearing only a bikini, was wrestled to the ground by the officer. When others ran to her, Casebolt briefly drew his firearm, sending them scrambling. He was then filmed sitting atop of Becton, his knees in her back as she wailed for her mother.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n <p><small><\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><br /><\/p><p>Footage of the incident soon sparked a media firestorm, and almost 10 million people viewed it on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R46-XTqXkzE&amp;feature=youtu.be\">YouTube<\/a>. Casebolt was placed on administrative leave as his superiors investigated his actions, while black community leaders called for the officer&rsquo;s firing amid a <a href=\"Protesters%20Rally%20After%20Texas%20Police%20Officer%20Pulls%20Gun%20On%20Teens%20At%20Pool%20Party\">protest by hundreds of demonstrators<\/a> through the town on Monday night. He <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/claudiakoerner/mckinney-police-officer-filmed-in-pool-party-response-resign?bftwnews&amp;utm_term=4ldqpgc#.hsdb1ab0g\">resigned late Tuesday<\/a>, with Chief of Police Greg Conley describing his actions as \"out of control\" and \"indefensible.\"<\/p><p>In multiple media interviews, Sean Toon, 33, has promoted himself as a witness who is able to provide a clear, firsthand picture of the &ldquo;chaos&rdquo; unfolding at the pool on Friday night.<\/p><p>\"Watching 30 seconds or seven minutes of a clip, it doesn&#39;t tell the whole story,\" Toon told his local ABC affiliate <a href=\"http://www.wfaa.com/story/news/local/collin-county/2015/06/07/party-organizer-says-cop-actions-unneccessary/28665299/\">WFAA<\/a>. &ldquo;I think [Casebolt] did what he thought he had to do to control the situation.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n<p>On Monday night, Toon was also interviewed, using only his first name, by <a href=\"http://video.foxnews.com/v/4284340105001/witness-resident-sound-off-on-the-texas-pool-party-incident/?playlist_id=2694949842001#sp=show-clips\">Fox News&rsquo; Megyn Kelly<\/a> and explained why he called the cops. A section of the interview was replayed on Tuesday morning&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://video.foxnews.com/v/4285035780001/texas-witnesses-teens-recall-pool-party-arrest-differently/?#sp=show-clips\"><i>Fox &amp; Friends<\/i><\/a>, with Toon&rsquo;s version of events promoted by the Fox anchors as providing a fuller picture than the seven-minute YouTube video.<\/p><p>What Toon has failed to mention, though, is that he was part of a group of adults that, according to teens at the pool party, initially made racist comments to the mostly black youths, sparking a violent fight.<\/p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m 100% sure that he said, &lsquo;You should go back to the Section 8 [public] housing where you&rsquo;re from because you don&rsquo;t belong in our neighborhood,&rsquo;&rdquo; Grace Stone, a 14-year-old white McKinney resident who defended her black friends, told BuzzFeed News. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s when I went off. I called him an asshole. He had no right to say that. You shouldn&rsquo;t be that hateful. That&rsquo;s when [one of Toon&#39;s female acquaintances] came up to me and said, &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t talk to adults like that.&rsquo; She was saying I needed to do something with my life and find a nice path for myself.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Barber Toon acknowledged to BuzzFeed News the women she had been with at the pool were involved in the fight. After calling the police to complain of teens jumping the pool fence, she took her children home before the incident, leaving her husband with the two women.<\/p><p>Tatyana Rhodes, a Craig Ranch resident who organized the party, echoed Stone&rsquo;s version of events. \"This lady was saying racial slurs to some friends who came to the cookout,&rdquo; Rhodes said in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=37&amp;v=uZjHwOHFJGk\">YouTube interview<\/a> with photographer Elroy Johnson. &ldquo;She was saying things such as &lsquo;black f**cker&rsquo; and, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s why you live in Section 8 homes.&rsquo;\"<\/p><p>\"There was also a male that was saying rude things,\" she said. Emmanuel Obi, the lawyer now representing Rhodes, refused to allow BuzzFeed News to speak with his client to identify those she said made the racist comments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n <p><small><\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>The verbal confrontation soon became physical and a fight broke out between Rhodes and Toon&rsquo;s two acquaintances, one of whom is a McKinney resident who has since deleted her Facebook page after her name was shared by activists on social media. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/k1dmars/status/607031054147452928\">Cell phone footage<\/a> of the fight doesn&rsquo;t show who became physical first, but Rhodes has alleged she was slapped by one of the women.<br /><\/p><p>McKinney police spokesman Officer Terry Qualls would not comment directly on the fight between the adults and teens, but did tell BuzzFeed News &ldquo;the whole incident at the pool is the subject of investigation.&rdquo;<\/p><p>In his interview Monday night on Fox, Toon didn&rsquo;t make clear that he was acquainted with the two women involved in the fight. &ldquo;There was a fight between a young black girl and two middle-aged white females,\" he said. \"They were not [security guards]. One of them I know was a resident. The other one I believe was visiting a resident there.&rdquo;<\/p><p>On Fox, Toon also denied anyone making racist comments, saying that the teens were accusing the adult residents of racism for simply objecting to their boisterous behavior at the pool.<\/p><p>When asked by BuzzFeed News on Monday night whether she recalled her husband or anyone making any racist comments to the teens, Shannon Barber Toon said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where it&rsquo;s a little fuzzy for me. I know there were people yelling at each other. The only racial thing I heard was spoken by some of the black girls inside the pool area saying, &lsquo;They just want to kick us out because we black.&#39;&rdquo;<\/p><p>&ldquo;I know I heard somebody say something about Section 8 housing,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know who said it. I honestly don&rsquo;t remember who said what.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-06/9/14/enhanced/webdr10/grid-cell-6186-1433874581-3.jpg\" width=\"309\" height=\"204\" alt=\"\" /><\/p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Fox News<\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>While refusing to provide contact information for her husband or acquaintances, Shannon Barber Toon said Tuesday &ldquo;there is no way&rdquo; her husband made the comments. Although she acknowledged she left before the fight broke out and had &ldquo;no idea&rdquo; whether her friends made racist comments, she said she &ldquo;highly doubts&rdquo; they made the remarks as they are &ldquo;not racist in any stretch.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Section 8 housing has been a thorny issue for the community, she said, due to proposals to bring public housing to Craig Ranch. &ldquo;We hate it. We don&rsquo;t want that.

Her daughter, Grace, was handcuffed by police for around 30 minutes after trying to give her version of events to the officers. Grace said she was the only white person detained.<\/p><p>&ldquo;You hear people generalizing the kids who got cuffed.

Mone / AP<\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Surrounded by expensive homes and a lush green park, the pool in Craig Ranch, McKinney, has long functioned as a focal point for its community. Residents call the Dallas-area city an idyllic Texan town, and streets in the planned estate are referred to as &ldquo;trails,&rdquo; with names like Lonesome Spur, White Stallion, and Desert Dunes conjuring up images of the Old West. On hot summer days, parents and kids stroll from nearby designer brick homes to relax and cool off in the pool, which residents need a card to use. Sometimes the pool hosts movie nights, handing out popcorn as swimmers watch films on a large inflatable screen.<br /><\/p><p>&ldquo;I love our neighborhood,&rdquo; Craig Ranch resident Shannon Barber Toon, who has lived in McKinney for four years, told BuzzFeed News. &ldquo;I love that I can walk my kids to the pool. We have friends of all races. You can always come out and find people to talk to.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Barber Toon went to the pool Friday night with her husband, Sean Toon, their two children, and her two female friends. Later that evening, though, the pool would become the latest flash point for America&rsquo;s ongoing debate over race relations and police brutality. Sean Toon has claimed in multiple media interviews that the media has misrepresented the events, but Toon himself has failed to tell the full story.<\/p><p>Tension broke out at the pool after dozens of mostly black teenagers had arrived for an end-of-school party that grew well beyond its planned size. There was a professional DJ playing music, but no tickets were sold and the organizers didn&#39;t throw the party for profit, teens told BuzzFeed News. They also vehemently denied reports that some were using drugs or alcohol. Many kids had cards to the pool and others were using shared guest passes to gain entry, but when pool attendants stopped letting people in some began jumping the fence.<\/p><p>Soon, the Toons and others called police. Teens fled, and one officer began frantically rounding up anyone he could. In video of the ensuing scenes, Cpl. Eric Casebolt is seen frantically barrel-rolling into frame, before ordering mostly black teens on to the ground, while their white classmates are left to stand by and film the events. After she and her friends were ordered by Casebolt to leave, Dajerria Becton, a black teen wearing only a bikini, was wrestled to the ground by the officer. When others ran to her, Casebolt briefly drew his firearm, sending them scrambling. He was then filmed sitting atop of Becton, his knees in her back as she wailed for her mother.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n <p><small><\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><br /><\/p><p>Footage of the incident soon sparked a media firestorm, and almost 10 million people viewed it on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R46-XTqXkzE&amp;feature=youtu.be\">YouTube<\/a>. Casebolt was placed on administrative leave as his superiors investigated his actions, while black community leaders called for the officer&rsquo;s firing amid a <a href=\"Protesters%20Rally%20After%20Texas%20Police%20Officer%20Pulls%20Gun%20On%20Teens%20At%20Pool%20Party\">protest by hundreds of demonstrators<\/a> through the town on Monday night. He <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/claudiakoerner/mckinney-police-officer-filmed-in-pool-party-response-resign?bftwnews&amp;utm_term=4ldqpgc#.hsdb1ab0g\">resigned late Tuesday<\/a>, with Chief of Police Greg Conley describing his actions as \"out of control\" and \"indefensible.\"<\/p><p>In multiple media interviews, Sean Toon, 33, has promoted himself as a witness who is able to provide a clear, firsthand picture of the &ldquo;chaos&rdquo; unfolding at the pool on Friday night.<\/p><p>\"Watching 30 seconds or seven minutes of a clip, it doesn&#39;t tell the whole story,\" Toon told his local ABC affiliate <a href=\"http://www.wfaa.com/story/news/local/collin-county/2015/06/07/party-organizer-says-cop-actions-unneccessary/28665299/\">WFAA<\/a>. &ldquo;I think [Casebolt] did what he thought he had to do to control the situation.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n<p>On Monday night, Toon was also interviewed, using only his first name, by <a href=\"http://video.foxnews.com/v/4284340105001/witness-resident-sound-off-on-the-texas-pool-party-incident/?playlist_id=2694949842001#sp=show-clips\">Fox News&rsquo; Megyn Kelly<\/a> and explained why he called the cops. A section of the interview was replayed on Tuesday morning&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://video.foxnews.com/v/4285035780001/texas-witnesses-teens-recall-pool-party-arrest-differently/?#sp=show-clips\"><i>Fox &amp; Friends<\/i><\/a>, with Toon&rsquo;s version of events promoted by the Fox anchors as providing a fuller picture than the seven-minute YouTube video.<\/p><p>What Toon has failed to mention, though, is that he was part of a group of adults that, according to teens at the pool party, initially made racist comments to the mostly black youths, sparking a violent fight.<\/p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m 100% sure that he said, &lsquo;You should go back to the Section 8 [public] housing where you&rsquo;re from because you don&rsquo;t belong in our neighborhood,&rsquo;&rdquo; Grace Stone, a 14-year-old white McKinney resident who defended her black friends, told BuzzFeed News. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s when I went off. I called him an asshole. He had no right to say that. You shouldn&rsquo;t be that hateful. That&rsquo;s when [one of Toon&#39;s female acquaintances] came up to me and said, &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t talk to adults like that.&rsquo; She was saying I needed to do something with my life and find a nice path for myself.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Barber Toon acknowledged to BuzzFeed News the women she had been with at the pool were involved in the fight. After calling the police to complain of teens jumping the pool fence, she took her children home before the incident, leaving her husband with the two women.<\/p><p>Tatyana Rhodes, a Craig Ranch resident who organized the party, echoed Stone&rsquo;s version of events. \"This lady was saying racial slurs to some friends who came to the cookout,&rdquo; Rhodes said in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=37&amp;v=uZjHwOHFJGk\">YouTube interview<\/a> with photographer Elroy Johnson. &ldquo;She was saying things such as &lsquo;black f**cker&rsquo; and, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s why you live in Section 8 homes.&rsquo;\"<\/p><p>\"There was also a male that was saying rude things,\" she said. Emmanuel Obi, the lawyer now representing Rhodes, refused to allow BuzzFeed News to speak with his client to identify those she said made the racist comments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n <p><small><\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>The verbal confrontation soon became physical and a fight broke out between Rhodes and Toon&rsquo;s two acquaintances, one of whom is a McKinney resident who has since deleted her Facebook page after her name was shared by activists on social media. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/k1dmars/status/607031054147452928\">Cell phone footage<\/a> of the fight doesn&rsquo;t show who became physical first, but Rhodes has alleged she was slapped by one of the women.<br /><\/p><p>McKinney police spokesman Officer Terry Qualls would not comment directly on the fight between the adults and teens, but did tell BuzzFeed News &ldquo;the whole incident at the pool is the subject of investigation.&rdquo;<\/p><p>In his interview Monday night on Fox, Toon didn&rsquo;t make clear that he was acquainted with the two women involved in the fight. &ldquo;There was a fight between a young black girl and two middle-aged white females,\" he said. \"They were not [security guards]. One of them I know was a resident. The other one I believe was visiting a resident there.&rdquo;<\/p><p>On Fox, Toon also denied anyone making racist comments, saying that the teens were accusing the adult residents of racism for simply objecting to their boisterous behavior at the pool.<\/p><p>When asked by BuzzFeed News on Monday night whether she recalled her husband or anyone making any racist comments to the teens, Shannon Barber Toon said, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s where it&rsquo;s a little fuzzy for me. I know there were people yelling at each other. The only racial thing I heard was spoken by some of the black girls inside the pool area saying, &lsquo;They just want to kick us out because we black.&#39;&rdquo;<\/p><p>&ldquo;I know I heard somebody say something about Section 8 housing,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t know who said it. I honestly don&rsquo;t remember who said what.&rdquo;<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-06/9/14/enhanced/webdr10/grid-cell-6186-1433874581-3.jpg\" width=\"309\" height=\"204\" alt=\"\" /><\/p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Fox News<\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>While refusing to provide contact information for her husband or acquaintances, Shannon Barber Toon said Tuesday &ldquo;there is no way&rdquo; her husband made the comments. Although she acknowledged she left before the fight broke out and had &ldquo;no idea&rdquo; whether her friends made racist comments, she said she &ldquo;highly doubts&rdquo; they made the remarks as they are &ldquo;not racist in any stretch.&rdquo;<\/p><p>Section 8 housing has been a thorny issue for the community, she said, due to proposals to bring public housing to Craig Ranch. &ldquo;We hate it. We don&rsquo;t want that. We moved here thinking we were moving to an upscale neighborhood,&rdquo; Barber Toon said. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s never been about race.&rdquo;<\/p><p>In 2009, McKinney officials settled a <a href=\"http://www.danielbesharalawfirm.com/Documents/complaint%20filed.pdf\">lawsuit<\/a> brought by the <a href=\"http://www.danielbesharalawfirm.com/Pages/RepresentatieworkdonebyDBPCfortheInclusiveCommunitiesProjectInc.aspx\">Inclusive Communities Project,<\/a> a public housing advocacy group, which alleged the city was blocking the development of affordable residences in the more affluent and white western suburbs, where Craig Ranch lies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-06/9/14/enhanced/webdr15/grid-cell-24968-1433873736-17.jpg\" width=\"309\" height=\"204\" alt=\"\" /><\/p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Brandon Brooks<\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>On Sunday, Toon made a sign in support of the police department, posting it at the local pool and posing for reporters, and he has since frequently spoken out in support of Casebolt. &ldquo;He was the first officer to arrive there and I mean it was chaos when he arrived there,&rdquo; he told Megyn Kelly on Fox. &ldquo;I think he kind of had to match that situation with a good amount of aggression to kind of calm the crowd down.&rdquo;<\/p><p>After replaying his comments on Tuesday morning, the <i>Fox &amp; Friends<\/i> hosts cut to an interview conducted with local black activist Dominique Alexander, who was highly critical of Casebolt&rsquo;s tactics.

His death was ruled a homicide. <\/p>\n\n<p>At the time of his death, Spear was being held at Rikers uncharged while he awaited a hearing for a robbery arrest.<\/p>\n\n<p>Officer Coll is charged with violating the Spear&#39;s civil rights when he allegedly attacked him after a verbal altercation between Spear and Coll erupted over Spear&#39;s medical treatment for severe kidney problems.

The FBI, the U.S. Marshals, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency, and the New York Department of Correction and Community Services are also participating in the search.\n\nIn total, some 450 law enforcement officers are involved in the manhunt, officials said.\n\nThe NYSP has received over 500 tips and is looking \"under every rock and behind every tree,\" said police Superintendent Joseph D'Amico.\n\n\"I have no information on where they are, or what they are doing, I'll be honest with you,\" D'Amico said.\n\nD'Amico added that the NYSP continues to search for the inmates in Willsboro, a small town 40 miles south of the prison, even though the original tip that led the police to the area turned out to be unfounded. State cops are also going door-to-door in Dannemora, the town where the prison is located. \n\nCuomo also confirmed that investigators are interviewing Joyce Mitchell, the seamstress who supervised the two inmates in a prison sewing shop, and who reportedly may have helped the inmates escape. He added that she is not the only employee under investigation.\n\n\"They're killers,\" Cuomo said, warning people not to confront the inmates and to alert the authorities of any suspicious activity. \"They're murderers.

It also alleges the company did the same thing to a man who was about to take paternity leave.\n\n\"Nasty Gal has shown itself to be a horrible place to work for professional women who become pregnant,\" the lawsuit said.\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for Nasty Gal described the lawsuits to BuzzFeed News as \"defamatory\" and \"frivolous\":\n\n<blockquote>The accusations made in the lawsuits are false, defamatory and taken completely out of context. The layoffs in question were part of a larger restructuring of departments we completed over nine months ago. The lawsuits are frivolous and without merit.<\/blockquote>\n\nBut former employees who spoke on condition of anonymity told BuzzFeed News that the lawsuits were accurate, with one saying the sudden firing of Concepcion felt confusing and strangely timed because \"her sales and performance were up.\"",

The disease and the treatment caused her to suffer fatigue, and she began to come in later to accommodate her illness.\n\nIn 2013, Saberi took a leave from work for five weeks for surgery. The accountant claims when she returned to work in August 2013, she received a poor performance review. \n\nA year later, Saberi was let go due to the \"elimination of her role.\" She claims the loss of her job led to many complications with her medical care, as her insurance had lapsed.\n\nSaberi is suing the company for wrongful termination and discrimination, among other things, and is seeking unspecified damages. \n\nHer attorney told BuzzFeed News the case is likely headed to arbitration.

The two hardened criminals had apparently used power tools to cut through the thick steel at the back of their adjoining cells, shimmied their way down a six-story catwalk, made a hole into a metal drainpipe, then crawled for 400 feet to emerge from a manhole blocks away from the prison.<\/p><p>On Tuesday, as the manhunt for the killers entered its third day, many questions about the escape remained unanswered, but one of them stood out: How did two inmates locked up in a maximum security prison get their hands on a set of power tools?<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-06/9/16/enhanced/webdr09/enhanced-buzz-30428-1433882820-7.jpg\" width=\"625\" height=\"416\" alt=\"\" /><\/p>\n \n\t<p>The holes in the back wall of the inmates&#39; cells.<\/p>\n\n\n <p><small>Handout / Getty Images<\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Appearing on morning television shows on Monday, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Matt and Sweat likely had help from inside the prison, adding that the investigation was centering on civilian employees and outside contractors.<br /><\/p><p>On Tuesday, the New York State Police said in a statement that investigators were questioning several employees at the facility, but had made no arrests. The <i><a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/felons-escaped-n-y-prison-cuomo-article-1.2250257\">New York Daily News<\/a><\/i> reported that law enforcement officials were questioning Joyce Mitchell, a civilian employee who supervised the two escaped inmates in a prison sewing workshop where they made Metro-North Uniforms.<\/p><p>Mitchell, who has reportedly been <a href=\"http://7online.com/news/female-prison-worker-removed-from-post-after-being-questioned-in-escape-of-2-murderers/769902/\">removed from her position<\/a> at the prison, could not be reached for comment. Her son, Tobey Mitchell, <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/son-prison-worker-questioned-escape-says-she-would-never-assist-n372416\">told NBC News<\/a> that his mother wouldn&#39;t \"risk her life or other people&#39;s lives to help these guys escape.\"<\/p><p>And an expert who has spent more than 30 years visiting jails and prisons in New York told BuzzFeed News that he believes it would be unlikely for a sewing shop to have the kind of power tools necessary to cut through steel walls and drainage pipes.<\/p><p>\"The tools that were used in this break are not the kind of tools that you would see in a prison workshop,\" said professor Charles Ewing, a forensic psychologist and attorney who works at the University at Buffalo Law School. \"They are the kind of tools you would expect someone to bring in if they are doing major construction work.\"<\/p><p>Ewing explained that most New York State prisons have vocational training programs where inmates routinely use tools. Many facilities, he said, have \"factory-style shops\" where convicts make furniture or perform other kinds of light industrial work, such as making air conditioning units.<\/p><p>\"It seems odd to me that these guys could have taken tools form a tailor shop that could be used to cut through a steel wall,\" Ewing said. \"These inmates had to know precisely where to go, where to cut. This wasn&rsquo;t a crime of opportunity. This had to have been very well planned.\"<\/p><p>He added: \"I find it hard to believe this somehow relates to the tailor shop. I think it&#39;s more likely they got ahold of something from a contractor. If there was plumbing work being done, that might have involved pipe cutting and handheld power tools.\"<\/p><p>The New York state government routinely contracts with outside companies to perform maintenance work at its prisons. In the month before the break, there were at least 13 different companies performing no less than 18 construction, plumbing, or electrical jobs at the facility, according to <a href=\"http://www.openbooknewyork.com/\">data from the New York state comptroller<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-06/9/16/enhanced/webdr13/enhanced-mid-32335-1433882698-2.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" alt=\"\" /><\/p>\n \n\t<p>Contractors recently hired by the New York State Office of General Services to perform construction work at the Clinton Correctional Facility.<\/p>\n\n\n <p><small>New York State Comptroller / BuzzFeed News<\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>The jobs included everything from rehabilitating residential showers to replacing the windows of the industry building. Most of the contracts came through the New York State Office of General Service. The state&#39;s Department of Corrections and Community Services had also hired the Schindler Elevator Corporation to perform elevator maintenance at the facility.<br /><\/p><p>Reached by email, a spokesperson from the Schindler Elevator Corporation told BuzzFeed News that the work did not involve power tools of any kind and that the corporation had not been contacted by law enforcement.<\/p><p>A representative for Steven Fuller Excavations told BuzzFeed News that the work the company was hired to do took place entirely outside the prison walls and did not involve any contact with inmates. He also said his company had not been contacted by investigators.<\/p><p>Representatives of the other contractors either did not respond or declined to answer questions about use of power tools or whether they had been contacted by investigators.<\/p><p>The New York State Police, the FBI, the U.S. Marshall, and the State Department of Corrections and Community Services all declined to comment on whether they had questioned any of the contractors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-06/9/16/enhanced/webdr15/enhanced-buzz-25862-1433883271-7.jpg\" width=\"625\" height=\"469\" alt=\"\" /><\/p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Handout / Getty Images<\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Asked about security protocols in place at the facility, Ewing said civilians are usually required to call a few days in advance. He also recalled seeing contractors at work in many of his visits to the Clinton Correctional Facility.<\/p><p>\"These facilities are very secure,\" he said. \"But from time to time, they clearly have to rely upon outsiders to do certain kinds of jobs. I&rsquo;ve been to facilities when I&rsquo;ve seen contractors coming and going, but I never thought much about the work they were doing.\"<\/p><p>Setting aside the question of how the inmates got the tools, Ewing remained baffled by the escape.<\/p><p>\"This particular facility was built in the mid-19th century &mdash; it&#39;s like fortresses, the walls are huge,\" he said. \"Even if you have the tools, to break out from one of these facilities, it&rsquo;s extraordinary.\"<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   <p><strong>LINK:<\/strong> <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/nicolasmedinamora/police-reportedly-close-to-escaped-inmates-in-small-new-york#.fd6XRnd10\" rel=\"nofollow\">Police Reportedly Close In On Escaped Inmates In Small New York Town<\/a><\/p>\n\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small><\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n <p><small><\/small><\/p>",

The two hardened criminals had apparently used power tools to cut through the thick steel at the back of their adjoining cells, shimmied their way down a six-story catwalk, made a hole into a metal drainpipe, then crawled for 400 feet to emerge from a manhole blocks away from the prison.<\/p><p>On Tuesday, as the manhunt for the killers entered its third day, many questions about the escape remained unanswered, but one of them stood out: How did two inmates locked up in a maximum security prison get their hands on a set of power tools?<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-06/9/16/enhanced/webdr09/enhanced-buzz-30428-1433882820-7.jpg\" width=\"625\" height=\"416\" alt=\"\" /><\/p>\n \n\t<p>The holes in the back wall of the inmates&#39; cells.<\/p>\n\n\n <p><small>Handout / Getty Images<\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Appearing on morning television shows on Monday, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Matt and Sweat likely had help from inside the prison, adding that the investigation was centering on civilian employees and outside contractors.<br /><\/p><p>On Tuesday, the New York State Police said in a statement that investigators were questioning several employees at the facility, but had made no arrests. The <i><a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/felons-escaped-n-y-prison-cuomo-article-1.2250257\">New York Daily News<\/a><\/i> reported that law enforcement officials were questioning Joyce Mitchell, a civilian employee who supervised the two escaped inmates in a prison sewing workshop where they made Metro-North Uniforms.<\/p><p>Mitchell, who has reportedly been <a href=\"http://7online.com/news/female-prison-worker-removed-from-post-after-being-questioned-in-escape-of-2-murderers/769902/\">removed from her position<\/a> at the prison, could not be reached for comment. Her son, Tobey Mitchell, <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/son-prison-worker-questioned-escape-says-she-would-never-assist-n372416\">told NBC News<\/a> that his mother wouldn&#39;t \"risk her life or other people&#39;s lives to help these guys escape.\"<\/p><p>And an expert who has spent more than 30 years visiting jails and prisons in New York told BuzzFeed News that he believes it would be unlikely for a sewing shop to have the kind of power tools necessary to cut through steel walls and drainage pipes.<\/p><p>\"The tools that were used in this break are not the kind of tools that you would see in a prison workshop,\" said professor Charles Ewing, a forensic psychologist and attorney who works at the University at Buffalo Law School. \"They are the kind of tools you would expect someone to bring in if they are doing major construction work.\"<\/p><p>Ewing explained that most New York State prisons have vocational training programs where inmates routinely use tools. Many facilities, he said, have \"factory-style shops\" where convicts make furniture or perform other kinds of light industrial work, such as making air conditioning units.<\/p><p>\"It seems odd to me that these guys could have taken tools form a tailor shop that could be used to cut through a steel wall,\" Ewing said. \"These inmates had to know precisely where to go, where to cut. This wasn&rsquo;t a crime of opportunity. This had to have been very well planned.\"<\/p><p>He added: \"I find it hard to believe this somehow relates to the tailor shop. I think it&#39;s more likely they got ahold of something from a contractor. If there was plumbing work being done, that might have involved pipe cutting and handheld power tools.\"<\/p><p>The New York state government routinely contracts with outside companies to perform maintenance work at its prisons. In the month before the break, there were at least 13 different companies performing no less than 18 construction, plumbing, or electrical jobs at the facility, according to <a href=\"http://www.openbooknewyork.com/\">data from the New York state comptroller<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-06/9/16/enhanced/webdr13/enhanced-mid-32335-1433882698-2.png\" width=\"720\" height=\"412\" alt=\"\" /><\/p>\n \n\t<p>Contractors recently hired by the New York State Office of General Services to perform construction work at the Clinton Correctional Facility.<\/p>\n\n\n <p><small>New York State Comptroller / BuzzFeed News<\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>The jobs included everything from rehabilitating residential showers to replacing the windows of the industry building. Most of the contracts came through the New York State Office of General Service. The state&#39;s Department of Corrections and Community Services had also hired the Schindler Elevator Corporation to perform elevator maintenance at the facility.<br /><\/p><p>Reached by email, a spokesperson from the Schindler Elevator Corporation told BuzzFeed News that the work did not involve power tools of any kind and that the corporation had not been contacted by law enforcement.<\/p><p>A representative for Steven Fuller Excavations told BuzzFeed News that the work the company was hired to do took place entirely outside the prison walls and did not involve any contact with inmates. He also said his company had not been contacted by investigators.<\/p><p>Representatives of the other contractors either did not respond or declined to answer questions about use of power tools or whether they had been contacted by investigators.<\/p><p>The New York State Police, the FBI, the U.S. Marshall, and the State Department of Corrections and Community Services all declined to comment on whether they had questioned any of the contractors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\t\n\n   <p><img src=\"http://ak-hdl.buzzfed.com/static/2015-06/9/16/enhanced/webdr15/enhanced-buzz-25862-1433883271-7.jpg\" width=\"625\" height=\"469\" alt=\"\" /><\/p>\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small>Handout / Getty Images<\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Asked about security protocols in place at the facility, Ewing said civilians are usually required to call a few days in advance. He also recalled seeing contractors at work in many of his visits to the Clinton Correctional Facility.<\/p><p>\"These facilities are very secure,\" he said. \"But from time to time, they clearly have to rely upon outsiders to do certain kinds of jobs. I&rsquo;ve been to facilities when I&rsquo;ve seen contractors coming and going, but I never thought much about the work they were doing.\"<\/p><p>Setting aside the question of how the inmates got the tools, Ewing remained baffled by the escape.<\/p><p>\"This particular facility was built in the mid-19th century &mdash; it&#39;s like fortresses, the walls are huge,\" he said. \"Even if you have the tools, to break out from one of these facilities, it&rsquo;s extraordinary.\"<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   <p><strong>LINK:<\/strong> <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/nicolasmedinamora/police-reportedly-close-to-escaped-inmates-in-small-new-york#.fd6XRnd10\" rel=\"nofollow\">Police Reportedly Close In On Escaped Inmates In Small New York Town<\/a><\/p>\n\n \n\t\n\n\n <p><small><\/small><\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n <p><small><\/small><\/p>",
